Always<br>seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health care provider with any questions you may have<br>regarding a medical condition or treatment and before undertaking a new health care regime. Never disregard<br>professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of information you have read in this booklet.<br>The treatments described work on a subtle level and are based on experience and partially on Ayurvedic<br>traditions. These methods cannot always be proved effective by the academic medicine of today.<br>In case of pain, ailments, mental or psychic problems appearing during a treatment, it should be terminated;<br>in case of need a physician should be consulted.<br>On the Occasion of Sahasrara Day 2022<br>“You have to keep the temple of God healthy and happy.” Shri Mataji’s words emphasize the ancient<br>message of integration of all aspects of existence, but here is a decisive difference. She has<br>actually enabled the seekers ‘to know Thy Self’, that is to experience and enjoy the spiritual reality.<br>By granting the experience of Self-realisation a quantum jump in our awareness is made possible,<br>giving rise to thoughtless awareness – the meditative witness state. We are able to feel love<br>flowing through our hearts and perceive the all-pervading energy. The latter is referred to as<br>‘vibratory awareness’ or simply ‘vibrations’, in order to attune ancient vocabulary to a modern<br>global language.<br>Why is this important for matters of health? Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji’s method of en-masse<br>Self-realisation, gives us an added ‘sixth sense’ in the detection, understanding and tackling of<br>imbalances and shortcomings in our mental, emotional and physical beings. Naturally, keen<br>medical doctors have systematically tested the claim on a scientific basis and with outstanding<br>success. The information presented here has not been ‘learned’ but is innate knowledge coming<br>from direct experience. Following Shri Mataji’s words, the content of this book can be compared<br>to reading a recipe – it is not the medicine itself. The medicine is to develop the state of meditation,<br>the inner yoga. In other words, the methods described are ‘state-specific’,<br>they work only after Self-realisation.<br>It is seen as good practice to give a brief explanation of the nature of Shri Mataji’s recorded talks.<br>Many of them used for this publication occurred in a very informal setting, for example in hands-<br>on workshops, living room conversations, medical discussions and live media interviews. There<br>She dealt with immediate health issues, intellectual inquiries and spiritual needs of the people<br>around Her and encouraged them to practice on the spot what they had just learned. All in all,<br>these recordings are the opposite of a typical structured academic lecture like the one Shri Mataji<br>gave at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing 1995.<br>The transcription process has tried to achieve a balance between preserving some of the lively and<br>spontaneous atmosphere and the readability of the spoken word. Any editing has been fully in line<br>with the recommendations&#x2F;guidance Shri Mataji gave on this subject in Sheffield, UK.<br>We are wholeheartedly grateful to Shri Mataji for giving us the knowledge to succeed in making<br>our bodies a fitting abode for our spiritual ascent to the Spirit. The application of wisdom<br>presented here is for the benefit of humanity and has been given freely by Shri Mataji.<br>This is Her legacy.<br>Jai Shri Mataji<br>1<br>Contents<br>Basics � � � � � � � � � � 3<br>The Experience � � � � � � � � � � � �4<br>Liver � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �6<br>Food � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �7<br>Science � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �8<br>Diseases &amp; Remedies<br>from A – Z � � � � � � �11<br>Aids  � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �12<br>Allergies � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �12<br>Amoebic Dysentery � � � � � � � �13<br>Anger � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �13<br>Angina � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �13<br>Anorexia � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �14<br>Antibodies Deficit � � � � � � � � �14<br>Arthritis � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �15<br>Asthma � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �16<br>Autism � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � 17<br>Blindness � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � 17<br>Breast Cancer � � � � � � � � � � � � 17<br>Cancer � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �18<br>Cataract � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �19<br>Cholesterol � � � � � � � � � � � � � �19<br>Cold � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �19<br>Constipation � � � � � � � � � � � � �20<br>Dental Care � � � � � � � � � � � � � �20<br>Diabetes (Pancreas) � � � � � � �20<br>Diarrhoea � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � 21<br>Diet Confusion � � � � � � � � � � � 21<br>Diet for Hot Weather � � � � � � �22<br>Digestion Troubles � � � � � � � �22<br>Drugs � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �22<br>Ear Problems � � � � � � � � � � � �23<br>Epilepsy � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �23<br>Eczema � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �24<br>Eye Problems � � � � � � � � � � � �24<br>Fatigue � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �24<br>Fungal Infections � � � � � � � � �25<br>Fungus � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �25<br>Gas Trouble � � � � � � � � � � � � � �25<br>Gout� � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �25<br>Haemorrhoids � � � � � � � � � � � �25<br>Heritage Diseases � � � � � � � � �26<br>Hair Loss � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �26<br>Hallucinations � � � � � � � � � � �27<br>Hamsa Issues � � � � � � � � � � � �27<br>Headache � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �28<br>Heart Issues � � � � � � � � � � � � �28<br>Heart Attack � � � � � � � � � � � � �29<br>High Blood Pressure � � � � � � �29<br>Immune System Weakness �30<br>Impotency � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �30<br>Infertility � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �30<br>Insomnia � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � 31<br>2<br>Jaundice � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �32<br>Joint Troubles � � � � � � � � � � � �32<br>Knee &amp; Shoulder Problems �32<br>Left-Side Problems � � � � � � � �32<br>Lethargy � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �33<br>Leukaemia  � � � � � � � � � � � � � �33<br>Leucoderma � � � � � � � � � � � � �33<br>Liver (in general) � � � � � � � � �33<br>Liver (cold, lethargic) � � � � � �34<br>Liver (hot, overactive) � � � � �34<br>Low Blood Pressure � � � � � � �35<br>Lunacy � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �36<br>Menopausal Problems � � � � �36<br>Migraine � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �36<br>Multiple Sclerosis � � � � � � � � �36<br>Muscular Dystrophy � � � � � � �37<br>Myalgic Encephalomyelitis<br>(Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) 37<br>Myelitis � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �38<br>Negativity � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �38<br>Nervousness � � � � � � � � � � � � �39<br>Palpitations � � � � � � � � � � � � � �39<br>Pancreas � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �39<br>Paralysis � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �39<br>Parkinson � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �40<br>Peritoneum � � � � � � � � � � � � � �40<br>Perspiring � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �40<br>Pregnancy Issues � � � � � � � � �41<br>Prostate Gland Issues � � � � � �42<br>Radiation � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �42<br>Scabies � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �42<br>Schizophrenia � � � � � � � � � � �43<br>Self Esteem (Lack of) � � � � � �43<br>Sexuality Issues � � � � � � � � � �43<br>Shaking � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �43<br>Skin Troubles � � � � � � � � � � � �44<br>Spleen � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �45<br>Tic � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �45<br>Throat Issues � � � � � � � � � � � �45<br>Tuberculosis � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �46<br>Uterus Fibroids � � � � � � � � � � � � � �46<br>Varicose Veins  � � � � � � � � � � � � � �46<br>Viruses � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �47<br>Vomiting � � � � � � � � � � � � � � � �47<br>Wobbly Eyes  � � � � � � � � � � � � �48<br>Subtleties � � � � � � � 49<br>Coefficient of Divinity  � � � � �50<br>Cancer and the Collective<br>Subconsciousness � � � � � � � � �50<br>What is a difference between<br>a baddha and a bhoot?<br>How will you make out a<br>hindrance and a bhoot?

This side needs cooling. This is the basics.”<br>4<br>The Experience<br>Till the Kundalini has not broken the brahmarandhra, you cannot feel the cool breeze. … It is<br>absolutely spontaneous. If your heart is clean it will break, if your heart is strong it will break,<br>but if you have a weak heart it will not break. If you are suffering from a heart trouble, it will not<br>break.<br>1983-02-04 New Delhi, India<br>You have to get your vibrations in your hands to begin with. Some people who have had<br>problems with their hands, because of previous life or some sort of a thing, they feel their<br>chakras in their own places. Then after some time, you will start feeling your chakras in your<br>brain. After that you need not feel the chakras at all. You just say, “This is it”. Finished!<br>1983-02-02 New Delhi, India<br>How do you feel vibrations? When do you feel vibrations? How do you lose vibrations?<br>What happens? All those things are just within yourself.<br>Of course, after some time, we might be able to say what behavioural changes one should take.<br>But you can find out yourself, if you want to find out – what is right and what is wrong and what<br>is to be done to keep up the vibrations.<br>But vibrations are, in one way, extremely charitable, very charitable things. Even if you do a little<br>wrong, they may not disappear that moment, but you will get a feeling within yourself that this<br>is wrong. After some time you will find, it will show that you have no vibrations and you would<br>not know that you have no vibrations! So, the first principle of sahaj dharma, or what you call<br>Vishwa Nirmala Dharma, is that you should be able to keep up your vibrations going as they are<br>or increase them or improve on their sensitivity. The more sensitive you are, the better you are.<br>If the sensitivity is lacking then one must say that Sahaja Yoga has failed in you so far, and you<br>have to work it out.<br>1985-08-06 London, UK<br>I will tell you a simple thing: This left hand is ‘minus’, and this [right hand] is ‘plus’. Whatever<br>you do with the left hand, you suck in. Whatever you do with the right hand, you give out. …<br>This [left] side needs heat. This [right] side needs cooling. This is the basics. If something wrong<br>with this [right] side, you have to give it the cool. If something wrong this [left] side, you have to<br>give it the heat.<br>1980-05-17.2 Old Alresford, UK<br>As an example, if you want to correct a liver which is overheated, you put the left hand on the<br>liver, and the right hand outside. You are taking the heat from the liver and giving it out with<br>the right hand.<br>1980-05-17.2 Old Alresford, UK<br>5<br>Depending on the quality of your centers, the chakras, they are the ones who really are the<br>channels for the energy of God to flow in. Regarding them, you have to be careful, how your<br>chakras are. Are you clean or not? Some of you will find a cool breeze flowing all right in the<br>hand, but maybe, one chakra is catching. On one chakra you will feel the heat, or you may feel<br>the numbness. You might feel also a kind of a, we can say, tingling on certain fingers.<br>Wherever there is tingling, you must know there is a kind of a struggle going on between those<br>chakras and the Kundalini. You should just try to help your chakras, to awaken them. Also, you<br>must know that every one of you is part and parcel of the whole. You are awakened now; you are<br>awakened to that part and so you have to be more careful.<br>1983-03-20 Sydney, Australia<br>The right side is heat, it is the Surya Nadi. When you have problem of Surya Nadi …<br>to neutralize it, you have to use something else [than fire].<br>You can take the name of Chandra and you will cool down. If the left side is catching, then you<br>have to take the name of Surya.<br>1980-05-17.2 Old Alresford, UK<br>For the right-sidedness, you can use the Mother Earth. Mother Earth is the best, or water and<br>salt. Water and salt are very good for people who are suffering from over-activity.<br>Now how do you do it? It is good for both [left- and right-sided], but specially for them [on the<br>right side]. You have to put both the hands first towards the photograph and put both the feet in<br>the water, with a bit of salt.<br>If you are feeling the vibrations coming in both the hands, equally the same, it is all right, you do<br>not have to worry. But supposing, one hand is more, and one hand is less [sensitive]? The hand<br>that is less has to go towards the photograph and the other one has to go out.<br>And you will be amazed. You will feel within yourself these balloons [of ego and superego]<br>moving; … you are getting relaxed.<br>1983-03-20 Sydney, Australia<br>For people who suffer from Ego, the best thing is to put your hands into the ice, the right hand<br>maybe. …<br>For people who suffer from Super Ego, a little bit of burning your hand in the candle may help,<br>just try.<br>Either you are a ‘frozen’ personality, or you are a ‘heated’ personality, you are not in the center.<br>If you are a frozen personality, better melt it a little bit. But do not burn it to have blisters! Just a<br>little bit, try to see – the sensitivity will improve.<br>1982-11-26 London, UK<br>6<br>Some things like clay is cool, it should be used for the right side, for the liver. … There are many<br>things which in effect are heat, they are good for the left side. For example, you can use light and<br>the sun. But for the right side you use water or ice.<br>Gradually you will know everything. Because you have got your Kundalini in your head, it will<br>give you all the light and you know all the knowledge.<br>1991-08-24 Moscow, Russia<br>Liver<br>How do we know which one [liver] is cold and which one is lethargic?<br>On vibrations you will know. There are symptoms connected with liver. ‘Cold’ must be an<br>enlarged liver, and ‘hot’ is contracted. For the liver, best is to look after the one which is heated<br>up, because it creates all the problems.<br>If it is enlarged, also you can reduce it by eating something like chana. … But not [food] which<br>can enlarge it, like rice can enlarge, then carbohydrates.<br>Also, what you have is milk, … milk gives you heat. There are so many things we take, which can<br>enlarge the thing [liver]. People who eat too much of sugar – that can enlarge it, because you<br>give sugar for a hot liver. Sugar we [only] give for a hot liver as a treatment.<br>2000-09-01 London, UK<br>This liver has a special capacity to extract all the poisons from the body as heat. And the heat<br>in the body is to be conveyed to the blood and that has to be taken out of the body, maybe as<br>perspiration or in other forms.<br>But what happens when this liver is out of gear? It cannot pass this heat into the blood stream<br>and the heat remains in the body and you become heated up. That makes all these problems<br>for you.<br>Those people who have a bad liver feel a little heat when the Kundalini rises.<br>1982-05-14 Brighton, UK<br>Some of you might start feeling hot in the hands. If so, you can just throw it away. Those who<br>are feeling the left hand hot should put your right hand on the heart. Those who are feeling hot<br>in the right hand, then you put your left hand on the liver, just below the ribs and right hand<br>towards me.<br>1979-05-24 London, UK<br>Liver trouble is another thing, you yourself do not feel. Others know you are liverish, the way<br>you are hot tempered, fussy and snarl at people. You are never satisfied with anything and you<br>criticise others. All this is liverish. Such liverish people are never happy with themselves.<br>7<br>The liver looks after your attention and those who have liver problems, their attention is horrid.<br>Their eyes are going this way, that way. Their attention is wobbly.<br>1982-05-14 Brighton, UK<br>A person who thinks too much, plans too much and thinks he is responsible for the whole world<br>affairs, in this myth develops his ego to a great extent. He uses his right-side Swadhisthan too<br>much by which his left side suffers too much and then he develops all the problems of the left<br>side in the organs.<br>First of all, the Swadhisthan cannot look after the liver, so he develops a [hot] liver. The liver<br>gives us the ego part. Lakshmana looks after the liver and destroys the ego.<br>1986-12-23 Nashik, India<br>Food<br>Any kind of food you eat has to be suitable for your temperament, your prakriti. It has to<br>be suitable.<br>Supposing you are a very right-sided person, then it is better for you to take more to<br>carbohydrates. But if you are a left-sided person, then is better for you to take to proteins.<br>There is no hard and fast rule about it. It has to be complementary to your nature. That is how<br>we decide. Every individual has a different temperament, and accordingly, we have to decide<br>what sort of food one should take.<br>1990-03-16 Sydney, Australia<br>All these things are meant either for the right side or for the left side, even food. They have<br>left- or right- [side] effects. Say, the sour fruits, we can call them the citrus fruit, like this<br>(Shri Mataji points to a type of plums; ed.), they are for the right side.<br>1991-08-24 Moscow, Russia<br>Right-sided people should have more carbohydrates, while the vegetarians should take more<br>proteins, but not animals which are bigger than you. If they do not like meat take to other<br>proteins, because proteins are very important.<br>1982-11-26 London, UK<br>If you want to reduce the activity of the [hot] liver, then you take sugar or carbohydrates. …<br>If you do not have protein in your food, the liver will become lethargic, weak and lethargic.<br>1982-10-13 London, UK<br>Right-sided people should take to foods which are left-sided, that is carbohydrates — means<br>they should become partly vegetarians, or quite a lot vegetarian — and should eat things at the<br>most like chicken, but neither fish nor seafoods, because they are all hot.<br>1983-01-21 Vaitharna, India<br>8<br>You have to take carbohydrates to neutralize that heat. If you do not like sugar, eat rice.<br>1981-10-18 Santa Cruz, CA, USA<br>We should not eat food immediately from the oven; sizzling food you should not eat. Let your<br>juices flow out to digest it and then eat it, otherwise you will burn your tongue or palate. Best is<br>to keep a tepid understanding of food, like water should not be very hot, food should not be<br>very hot.<br>After eating ice, they will have something hot suddenly, after that, or before … that is the worst<br>of all.<br>1982-01-25 Lonavala, India<br>After taking anything fried you should not take water or after eating fruit you should not take<br>water. You can take a biscuit or bread, something like that to dry up your throat, and then you<br>can take water. Sauces are very important for use with food to prevent drying of the membranes<br>of the throat.<br>1984-10-05 London, UK<br>Vegetarians can be very left-sided. They eat too much rice. It is just carbohydrates, is all starch<br>and vegetables, potatoes. All these things cause lethargy to the left side.<br>Dr. Rustom: Protein digestion starts up in the stomach and then it carries on in the<br>smaller intestines.<br>Shri Mataji continues: … and liver. That is the food for liver, no doubt. Though it does not take<br>part in the digestion, it uses the carbohydrates in the body. The liver is the only organ in the body<br>that can burn fat. It transforms it. Also, it removes the poison.<br>Now, if you take the cirrhosis case in India, it is because of the eating habits. You will always find<br>the vegetarians are eating nothing than starch, rice, potatoes. If you eat too much of these things,<br>the liver then will be starved. If you give sugar to the liver, then also the liver will<br>become lethargic.<br>1982-10-13 London, UK<br>If you do not have protein in your food, the liver will become lethargic and weak. When it<br>becomes weak then you get cirrhosis.<br>1982-10-13 London, UK<br>Science<br>Treatment according to personality and temperament. They are not bothered; they do not<br>understand these things. They just experiment, medical science is such a new science. Whatever<br>we have in our country [of India] is through the experimenting side. And secondly, we built all<br>our discovery on the experimentation on human beings as such and on basics like trigunatmika<br>and triguna. All the medicines are based on that.<br>9<br>The same approach was in the western culture. But they could not go very far with it. They gave<br>it up and they started a more symptom-wise [approach]. Whatever are your symptoms, the<br>symptoms are to be cured. But you do not take the whole into account.<br>That means there are three types of people and they have three problems. They are treated<br>accordingly. Then the balance is brought in.<br>For example, the person who is a Sahaja Yogini becomes a thin person. And the person who is on<br>the left side becomes a fatter person. And the central one is the one who has more of gas.<br>You do not have that gas system? And when the permutations and combinations of these go out of<br>balance, any imbalance is not good for health. It is not how you look. You hear from everybody,<br>‘if he looks bony, then he is healthy’.<br>But in India, maybe a bony person is a tubercular patient. Or a fat person is unhealthy, but<br>maybe the fat person may ascend. Maybe the person is having the sattwa guna. In India, [any<br>assessment] is done according to the personality and the person’s temperament. All these things<br>have to be taken into account.<br>Say, a man who will do too much of mental work – they will prescribe a diet which will consist<br>of more carbohydrate.

So many inches of waist and so many inches of neck and all that – it is<br>very outside.<br>A woman has to be left-sided. She has to be fatter, much fatter than man. She has to bear<br>children. Even in animal kingdom if you see, all the females have lots of fat. They have to have<br>fat because they have to sustain the child – they have to work for the child. If you find a western<br>girl, she is so thin, and she has children, she has to do household work and all that. Then she<br>becomes crazy.

These antibodies fight the disease or the attacker. The center heart in the central position<br>is the one for our immune system. When we commit ‘Sins against the Primordial Mother’, that is,<br>indulging in wrong type of perverted sex habits, alcohol, drugs, internal stress from anxiety and<br>fear of oppression, then this center goes into jeopardy, making our immune system weak, thereby<br>losing its power to help fight the diseases of the person.<br>Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi: Meta Modern Era. 1995<br>The chakra of Jagadamba has been made here.

This comes from the Mother Earth. You can also use the<br>mantra for the Mother Earth.<br>Doctor: Shri Mataji, why is it that your own antibodies harm you?<br>Shri Mataji: No, what happens is you have low level of calcium, and with that your bones become<br>like that. There are two types of arthritis. In one there is too much calcium, and in the other<br>there is a deficiency of calcium. [The one] which pains a lot, is gout.<br>Doctor: Osteoarthritis!<br>Shri Mataji: Yes, one that pains. There is a terrible pain all the time, on legs, on knees and so on.<br>16<br>… The painful [type] is due to calcium deficiency. …<br>And the other one you have [where you get crippled], is due to too much of calcium. In medical<br>science there is no differentiation. You do not have the same treatment for all. A person who has<br>pain should take phosphorus. I have written about phosphorus. Phosphorus gives you heat [and<br>with that heat] it improves. And the other one is due to over-calcium.<br>Doctor: Shri Mataji, in what form should we take phosphorus?<br>Shri Mataji: [Take] phosphorus itself. … [Also] in certain salts there is phosphorus.

By the first one you get bad colds and you get your attention<br>diverted and other problems of the ear, nose, throat. By the second one, when it is spoiled, you<br>say aggressive words, [make use] of sarcastic language, all kinds of things that breaks the<br>collectivity. … You hurt others.<br>There is also the mantra of Radha Krishna or Vitthala for the problems of ears, nose and throat<br>or where you get bad colds or where you get your attention diverted.<br>1985-05-02 Vienna, Austria<br>Epilepsy<br>Epilepsy is left-sided.

Then he<br>cannot bear it.<br>1986-11-04, New Delhi, India<br>The main characteristic of epilepsy is that here the individual resists the negativity. He does not<br>accept it.

So, epilepsy comes through the Agnya – from<br>Left Agnya.<br>Whoever has epilepsy, [you] must have a word with him first … [about] history, stress and fear;<br>how children are made fearful. … Clearance … is mainly of Mooladhara and Back Agnya.<br>The Back Agnya [can be in any] combination, one has to check.

Or any problem,<br>that comes through the generations?<br>Shri Mataji: The problems are like this. There is only one center which covers all the seven<br>centers, which is the Mooladhara – because it is the omkara, it is the chaitanya. The<br>Mooladhara is insulted if there is an incest relationship and the family grows, then it [the<br>impact] is [lasting for] seven generations.<br>But, if it is between a very holy relationship like mother and a son or something like that, then it<br>lasts for fourteen generations.<br>It is a complete insult of Shri Ganesh.

Dry up your throat and then take water.<br>Heat and cold – say, you take coffee and then take water. This is absolutely wrong. You should<br>take water, then gradually heated up and take coffee last. Then do not take water till you have<br>taken some carbohydrates. … The combination of heat and cold should be understood.<br>Now what do you do? Actually, you neglect certain laws of nature. Like in London or anywhere, it<br>is all heated up inside the rooms and it is very dry. You have to have a humidifier or keep some<br>water or some liquid or fill a tub in the bathroom and keep it open so that there is humidity<br>in the room. To compensate for all that one could take some water and sip in the nose. After<br>brushing your teeth, sip it thrice and thrice you take it out. By putting these fingers, these thumbs<br>in your ears and take it out. By that you will clear out your sinuses, you will make it humid.<br>For these parched mucus membranes, you can put some oil or some ghee. If this water can have<br>a little bit of salt, that is a good idea.

Now, the Divine vibration flows within us when we get our Self-<br>realization. Before that we are cut off from our Spirit.<br>The Spirit resides in our heart and our attention is not enlightened by that Spirit. The Spirit<br>watches us like a witness, … but the Kundalini, … the reflection of the Holy Ghost which<br>resides in the triangular bone, records everything that we do. It is just like a tape-recorder. …<br>It is a subtler knowledge; for that we have to extend ourselves. …<br>Our subtle being remains working as Parasympathetic Nervous System. This Parasympathetic<br>Nervous System is a system within us which nourishes us, gives us balance and repairs us just<br>like a fountain of every energy, but that too has limited energy. We use the Sympathetic Nervous<br>System when we have any emergencies – as we run fast and the heart can start pumping very<br>fast. When we relax, the heart comes back to its own position. That happens through the<br>Parasympathetic Nervous System. But it has a limited energy and that is how diseases are caused,<br>because we exhaust our limited energies due to some reason.<br>We have three powers within us. One of them is the left-hand side power of desire, the second<br>power is the right-hand side power of action and the central power of our evolution. The left-<br>hand side power is manifested in the gross as Left Sympathetic Nervous System, the right-hand<br>side is manifested within us as the Right Sympathetic Nervous System and the central one as the<br>Parasympathetic – so in the gross we call them by these names.<br>At the human stage when we [evolve], we start balancing ourselves by trial and error. … We go<br>from one extreme to another extreme, then we try to come to the center and when we come to<br>the center, that is the time our ascent takes place.<br>The left represents our past and the right represents our future, so we have to be in the present.<br>We have to be there, but we cannot. People might be thinking at this time about the past, may be<br>about the future; one thought rises and falls off, another thought rises and falls off.<br>In between the thought there is a little gap and that gap is the present. We cannot feel it within<br>ourselves because we live in the past or in the future.<br>When this Kundalini rises, she elongates those thoughts and by that elongation the gap between<br>the two thoughts increases and we become thoughtlessly aware.<br>1984-07-26 Hove, UK<br>Cancer and the Collective Subconsciousness<br>As I told you yesterday, with ‘effort’ you go in the wrong direction – either you move to the left<br>side or to the right side. When you move to the left side, what happens, you get ‘caught up’.<br>51<br>You get ‘caught up’ because on the left side all your collective consciousness is there. Cancer is<br>caused by negativities – that is the one [factor] that triggers [it].<br>I saw a television show in which the doctors were telling people that the vulnerability of the<br>cancer is first established when the sympathetic [nervous system] is too active. You become<br>vulnerable but triggering takes place with some proteins called ‘protein 58’ and ‘protein 52’.<br>[The doctors] they give just names.<br>They attack you and the triggering comes from the area, which is built within us since our<br>creation, the ‘Collective Subconscious’. Unless and until you get ‘caught up’ by something, cancer<br>cannot be triggered, though we are vulnerable every moment because we are so much on the<br>sympathetic. All the time we are in emergency.<br>… This ‘Collective Subconscious’ is existing within us since our creation. If you start moving too<br>much into it, when you bow to someone and submit to someone and that guru is an expert on<br>all these things, which we call in Sanskrit language as preta vidya or shmashana vidya. It is the<br>knowledge of the dead. Then they can entice you, they can mesmerise you, they can ask you to<br>kill yourself, they can do what they like. They will say, “Go and destroy yourself”. You have heard<br>of such cases where people have destroyed themselves. … But we must use our intelligence to<br>understand that, “Are we to destroy ourselves now?”.<br>1984-07-26 Hove, UK<br>What is a difference between a baddha and a bhoot? How will you make out<br>a hindrance and a bhoot?<br>A baddha is always on the centers or on your organs. If it is in the liver, this baddha may come<br>in the center and then it will start moving from here to here as the Kundalini will move. But a<br>baddha does not have its [own] arbitrary movement. As you move the Kundalini, the baddha<br>moves. Baddha means the ‘hindrance’.<br>But a bhoot is arbitrary. It moves; it will be one moment here; it will be one moment there. It will<br>move this side and that side. It will go to the Right Heart, then it will come to the Left Heart. If it<br>shows an arbitrary behaviour, that means it is not controlled by your movement of your fingers<br>through the Kundalini awakening, then you must know it is a bhoot.<br>You can say, if there is some lump in the body, it may start moving with the bloodstream, some<br>force is acting upon it. But by itself, it does not move. But if there is a worm, it will move by itself.<br>1980-05-17.2 Alresford, UK<br>It is only through Sahaja Yoga you can understand what lies in that brain.<br>All the seven centres about which I have told you in the previous lectures lie above this area.<br>52<br>To begin with the Mooladhara, it lies in the centre of your – at this point where the bone [at the<br>back of the head] is jetting out. I do not want to use medical terminology, because some people<br>told me they cannot understand it. Around that moves this Swadhisthana Chakra.<br>You must have seen people who suffer from diabetes they always lose their eye sight. The eye<br>sight is first affected when they have diabetics trouble. What is the reason?<br>The reason is, the Swadhisthana is in the stomach and the pitha or you can say the ‘seat’ of that<br>Swadhisthana Chakra is here at the back of your head, where the lobes which supply the energy<br>to the eyes is seated. Around that moves the Swadhisthana.<br>In the centre is the Mooladhara and around that moves the Swadhisthana, which is responsible<br>for this over activity. When we think too much, it is over active and the conversion of the fat cells<br>from the stomach to the brain is done in such a fast speed. When we think too much, we are<br>futuristic so that all other organs are neglected.<br>Such a Swadhisthana, which gets hectic, which does not understand what to do, now gets out of<br>gear. Because of that, one of the organs, the pancreas, gets no energy from the Swadhisthan. It<br>gets out of order and you develop diabetics. If anything goes wrong with the Swadhisthana, it<br>spoils the ‘seat’ of the Swadhisthana [moving] around the Mooladhara, which is in the center.<br>By that you get your eyes blinded, because it is pushing down the Mooladhara, which is in<br>its center. There is no use treating the eyes. The best is to treat your Mooladhara or treat<br>your Swadhisthana because the Swadhisthana is absolutely augmenting the movement of the<br>Mooladhara, which has to support the optic lobe.<br>It is so important to keep our mental being very sensible and balanced. It is very important. This<br>is only about one chakra, I have told you, but all the seven chakras lie above the limbic area.<br>1984-03-20 Delhi, India<br>Diseases caused by neglect of Mooladhara<br>Doctor: Multiple sclerosis, Shri Mataji, … it affects the nerves. The fat around the nerves<br>is finished.<br>Shri Mataji: I know, I have cured multiple sclerosis. The hands and legs become like this –<br>they stumble.<br>One thing I have seen is very surprising: if one of the two, husband and wife, is ‘caught up’ –<br>then the husband gets it if the wife is ‘caught up’, or if the husband is ‘caught up’, the wife gets it.<br>[This happens] when the Mooladhara gets a baddha.<br>Doctor: Shri Mataji, Left or Right Mooladhara?<br>Shri Mataji: It is left, son. You know, because if the husband is ‘caught up’, he is not all right,<br>53<br>he is left-sided, so the wife gets it, not the husband.<br>Whenever I ask them, “How is your wife?” or “How is your husband?”, it acts on the Mooladhara.<br>… You should treat the wife or the husband; … you can use chillies for the negativity.<br>There are many diseases you get out of negativity, which doctors are not sort of aware of it.<br>To be ‘caught up’ itself is a disease. Sometimes they get a bulge here, the skin bulges out like<br>that – then there is a negativity. All around the Agnya you get bulges like that – it is one of<br>the symptoms.<br>If it is a very extreme case, then you can make it out that it is a negativity when they start shaking<br>before My photograph, and shouting, screaming and all that. … Also, a person who has a<br>negativity is dull, but otherwise aggressive. … They are mostly overly aggressive on sexuality and<br>they are wayward. … They have roving eyes – but even a slight negativity can do that. They are<br>very fond of women and can create problems.<br>But the problem is the Mooladhara. The Mooladhara is such a great thing, it supports your<br>nervous system and also supports your muscular system.<br>They have been cured; multiple sclerosis has been cured in Sahaja Yoga. You must do worship of<br>Ganesha. Also, you can use [the smoke from ajwain], like as you use it for cold.<br>These days it is very common for human beings to be wayward, because the whole atmosphere is<br>like that. They’re talking about it all the time.<br>The trouble is, the one who is ‘caught up’ does not suffer; whosoever is married to a ‘caught up’<br>person gets it.<br>AIDS is a Mooladhara problem. The Mooladhara has countless problems. The Mooladhara must<br>be kept very much safe and honoured. The marriage is a sanctity, and one should live with<br>that sanctity.<br>But even women have so many diseases. If they go round with other women and all that, they can<br>catch [all these other diseases]; they all come from these bad women. [The diseases caused by<br>Mooladhara], all of them come from bad women. The whole culture is so bad that we are in for<br>trouble. Men want to have always a younger woman; so, one is discarded, then the second one is<br>discarded, like that it goes on.<br>2000-09-01 London, UK<br>The heated Swadhisthan and its Effects<br>This [Swadhisthan] center is very interesting. It comes out of the Solar Plexus, we call it as<br>Nabhi Chakra, and like a lotus it moves all round it. You can say in gross way it [manifests as]<br>the Aortic Plexus. … It is not [the Aortic Plexus], it supplies energy to the Aortic Plexus. This<br>54<br>center is very important because it gives energy to our liver, to the pancreas, to our spleen,<br>intestines and kidneys. …<br>But the most important work it does is … to supply energy to our gray cells [in the brain] which<br>we are using all the time. When we are thinking too much, when we are acting physically and<br>mentally, this center has to supply energy to our brain.<br>Ask the doctors how much we are using our gray cells? We have no idea. There is nobody who<br>has found out how much we use our brains, but we are going on exhausting our brains; we are<br>very futuristic.<br>What can happen medically to this Swadhisthan Chakra which has to supply [energy] to your<br>liver? The liver is the one which takes all the poison of the body and throws it into the circulation.<br>When liver is looked after, it is a normal process.<br>Then we have also a pancreas, a spleen, kidneys and the … intestines as a whole, but the last<br>part is very important. Such a man who is always thinking, all his energy is going to his brain<br>and all these organs are neglected and he can be affected by any one of them.<br>The first thing he is affected is a bad liver, because it cannot throw its heat, which is the poison<br>of the body, into the circulation. What happens, the heat starts rising; this heat goes higher on<br>the right side. There we call it Right Heart, the center which controls the lungs. Such a person<br>can get asthma.<br>This same thing happens to our pancreas, when it [the heat] moves to the left side. Now this heat<br>goes to the pancreas and gives you diabetes,<br>Then it goes down, then to the kidney; at the kidney it coagulates, and you cannot pass urine.<br>Also, it can give terrible constipation and with that you might get piles and things like that.<br>Now for the kidney, if you go to the dialysis, you not only die, but you die bankrupt. There is a<br>simple way of curing this kidney trouble and once this kidney is cured, it is cured forever. By<br>helping the Swadhisthan you can cure also the kidney.<br>The most difficult thing is the spleen. Now in modern times we are very hectic, and you see what<br>happens – the spleen, poor thing which has to produce red blood cells for emergencies, gets<br>mad. She cannot understand, “What is the matter with this gentleman?” and it cannot cooperate<br>with all the madness we have.<br>This futuristic life makes people really crazy. … The liver gives you heat, you become very hot<br>tempered at the slightest thing. You just shoot off and start saying things which you should never<br>have said. Then you feel guilty. When you feel guilty, you catch this center here, Left Vishuddhi<br>we call it, by which you develop spondylitis. …<br>Then this heat can pass to the spleen and then you get a disease called blood cancer.<br>55<br>According to Sahaja Yoga, we have two types of heart attacks. One is an active massive heart<br>attack and another one is what you call lethargic, like angina.<br>The first one is the massive one, where the heat reaches the heart. This heart suddenly collapses,<br>and they die. We call it an active heart attack due to over-acting.<br>Another one is the lethargic heart attack, like angina. That happens if this Vishuddhi center is<br>caught here, if you feel guilty.<br>The last but not the least is the effect of Swadhisthan as this heat reaches the brain and gives you<br>paralysis on the left-hand side. As you know, [the sympathetic nervous system] crosses over its<br>nerves. It gives you a terrible paralysis on the left-hand side, but you feel it on the right-hand side.<br>When the Kundalini rises, it nourishes those centers.<br>1997-04-06 Delhi, India and 1) 1998-10-02 Versilia, Italy<br>Spleen Issues<br>You get up in the morning and immediately start reading the newspaper, start getting agitated<br>and your speedometer has started shaking, with news like this person has been beaten, that<br>person has been hit.<br>The chakra, which is resting in your stomach, this speedometer is showing its effect. After this,<br>you get up and rush. You thought you go by vehicle, but there is lot of heavy traffic. Again, you are<br>frustrated. With great difficulty, on reaching office, there you find a lot of problems. You have not<br>taken proper food. Whatever food that is given by your wife, you are just gobbling it. There is lot<br>of trouble in this, and it results in blood cancer.<br>Because of a hectic life, running here, there – your speedometer gets spoilt as the red blood<br>corpuscles which have to make blood cells, go mad. In this madness, which we call ‘go crazy’, it<br>[the spleen] does not know which method to be used to supply blood to this mad person. Now<br>this, what you call ‘vulnerability’, has started with regard to your cancer. With this, call it either<br>black magic, bhoot vidya, or [false] guru prasad, or any such type of things – if they enter your<br>internal system, then blood cancer will be caused.<br>If any mother is of this type, in trouble from morning to evening, … this disease can happen to<br>her children also if she is pregnant at that point of time.<br>The entire society is made like this where everybody is working in troubled condition and<br>in chaos. On account of this, there is the possibility of getting blood cancer. According to<br>my thinking, there is nothing as such, for which a human being has to hurry up and create<br>confusion.<br>How can this be treated? The treatment is that, as soon as the Kundalini comes to your Nabhi<br>Chakra, peace will prevail. A human being becomes peaceful. He will be looking at things<br>56<br>peacefully. But that restless nature within us, that today’s nature is such that you are making a<br>venue for cancer to put its effect on you.<br>1986-04-02 Kolkata, India<br>Void Problems<br>The ‘Void’ can be spoilt by drugs and bad gurus. If you bow before any wrong guru, you catch<br>your Ekadesha Rudra. On the left side when you have been dominated in your guru tattva, going<br>to wrong gurus and doing wrong things.<br>Problems with the right side come if you think you are a great guru, of if you have tried to<br>dominate others by your ‘magnetism’. When the Ekadesha Rudra becomes very strong on the<br>physical level, you get horrible troubles with the body like cancer. Actually, cancer can be felt on<br>the stomach. You can feel the ‘lub-dub’ [of the pulse] on the stomach itself.<br>Problems come with spending your money for a wrong purpose or if somebody wants to make<br>money out of Sahaja, drinking too much, drugs, telling lies, stealing, killing … – all these<br>ten commandments. Fanaticism is against dharma. There are adharmic things as cabaret<br>dancing, adultery, undignified behaviour, alcohol, wrong gurus, reading bad books, fanaticism,<br>denouncing religions, materialism etc.<br>Various talks combined<br>Void Treatments<br>The ‘Void’ … can be cured by saying the mantra for the Adi Guru. Left-side guru tattva means<br>when you have had other [‘false’] gurus, then you have to say, ‘I am my own guru’. If you have<br>‘right’ side[affected], you have to say, ‘Mother you are my guru’. So, the five [dharmas] on the<br>right, and the five on the left can be solved.<br>What is the eleventh one? It is the Spirit, the Atma. For that you have to say, ‘I am the Spirit’.<br>The five left-side dharmas are corrected by taking vibrated salt, and the five right-side dharmas<br>are corrected by taking vibrated sugar. If someone drinks some water that has been vibrated that<br>person becomes dharmic.<br>Diarrhea is sometimes important to cleanse you out. It is alright because diarrhea and also<br>vomiting are a parasympathetic activity. It is clearing out.<br>Various talks combined<br>Vishuddhi Problems<br>On the left side, if you have been immoral, then there is the sister relationship, the guilt, confusion<br>with relationships with other men and other women. If we have a bad Agnya, or if there are eyes<br>57<br>which are roving, then this Left Vishuddhi causes a lot of trouble. Then we get problems like<br>sarcasm, shyness, timidity, problems of inferiority complex, slyness and people who never talk,<br>are uncollective, fearful and frightened and always see negativity in others, giving explanations,<br>instead of facing your faults and saying, ‘I was wrong’.<br>If you are lacking in protocol, as soon as you cross the limits, Left Vishuddhi is created.<br>There should be awe, respect for your Holy Mother.<br>Show-off, disturbing, or trying to be overpowering, or being a very forward person, or<br>bumptiousness – all these come from a Left Vishuddhi, because you want to overcome your Left<br>Vishuddhi; so you do it and then it is added to.<br>Tell yourself, “No! I have done this today, … tomorrow I am going to do it. … No! Stop it now!<br>Stop!”<br>On Center Vishuddhi there could be problems when we talk against God or are against God or<br>collectivity; [there could be] problems with communication, collectivity and an inability to sing,<br>If we take responsibility of everything upon ourselves it can result in tensions and headaches.<br>The remedy is to witness and realize that everything is done by the Divine. Most of us have bad<br>Vishuddhis, because we do not take responsibility, we take to negativity more easily and want<br>special things for ourselves.<br>On the right side it gives all kinds of political problems, we talk too much, too loudly or use our<br>words to intimidate others, be aggressive, arrogant or blunt. This is counteracted by madhuria,<br>sweetness, and also by going into mauna, silence. Sneezing is nothing but the Right Vishuddhi<br>opening out.<br>The problems can include hoarseness or loss of voice, if you take the name of God in vain, have<br>a habit of smiling for nothing at all, eyes that go on looking and pouring their greedy or lusty<br>eyes onto others – this is the worst thing you can do to your eyes – and showing anger with the<br>eyes, they can become mesmeric. It is a very, very dangerous thing to go on looking at something<br>continuously with concentration. Too much of nodding is very bad for the Vishuddhi Chakra.<br>There are so many problems … like Angina, Spondylitis, losing the voice completely or all the<br>time coughing. … Above all is the center of discrimination [the Hamsa Chakra] which only<br>comes [open] when you are free people. As long as you are biased, have your own concepts,<br>you cannot be discreet. … Some people think by their talks they can cheat you, by sweet talks,<br>artificial talks or by some maneuvering. They will get exposed and people know about them that<br>these are the greatest liars ever known.<br>1986-08-23 Plaffeien, Switzerland et al.<br>58<br>Vishuddhi Chakra Treatment<br>There is another thing called primrose oil. You can get two or three drops and take it with water.<br>That will also soothe your Vishuddhi. The oil keeps your Vishuddhi alright.<br>Olive oil can be used for a massage on the Vishuddhi, as well as the head and backbone. When<br>you touch somebody with oil, the Krishna tattva acts, because Krishna is the one who represents<br>the madhuria, the sweetness of your character. The voice should be melodious, and the language<br>should be controlled for saying things which are sweet and beautiful – speak of Sahaja Yoga.<br>Protect the throat from cold conditions from very childhood by having something around your<br>neck.<br>To correct the Left Vishuddhi, put the left hand towards the Mother or the photo, and right hand<br>on Mother Earth. Give a bandhan to the Left Vishuddhi and say in your heart, “Mother I am not<br>guilty”. Say it from your heart. Forget the past.<br>For the Right Vishuddhi, basil can be taken in tea and can be followed by an ajwain dhuni<br>treatment. It is corrected by madhuria, sweetness, and also by going into mauna, silence. There<br>is also the mantra of ‘Radha Krishna’, or ‘Vitthala’, where are problems of ears, nose and throat<br>or where you get bad colds, or your attention gets diverted.<br>To clear out most of your problems about Vishuddhi you have to put your fingers into your ears<br>and say ‘Allah ho Akbar’ 16 times.<br>1985-05-02 Vienna, Austria et al.<br>The Kavach of the Devi<br>This famous ancient prayer, asking for one’s protection of the Devi is a rich source of mantras,<br>assigning a specific deity to the various parts of the body for their protection.<br>You can use the entire Kavach or for a specific part of the body only the name of the<br>corresponding deity.

Is it [the Mooladhara] overdeveloped or underdeveloped? That is<br>the general principle for everything: If it overdeveloped then it is a ‘hot’ Mooladhara; if it<br>is underdeveloped it is a ‘cool’ Mooladhara. A hot Mooladhara is the Mooladhara which is<br>overused or has too much of heat, is overactive. …<br>Mooladhara is [collecting] jada. And over-activity creates more jada. [It is] like carbon dioxide<br>or anything like that, a waste product. All the waste products become inert and that inertness<br>gives additional size to the prostate. Then this jada can go into arthritis also.<br>Because whatever is jada, inert, is actually vibrations, frozen. They are a frozen type. …<br>It is like, if you put some colour in the hair, it settles down. Whatever jada you catch in the eyes,<br>it settles down. And if this gets spoiled then the prostate goes out. …<br>This has come because of over-reading, of seeing bad things, of all sort of things. The best thing<br>is for this, sleep on the Mother Earth and see the Mother Earth itself.<br>Then this inert material starts accumulating, and that is how you get this [prostate problem]. …<br>Doctor: Let us say that they have too much jada in that [overactive] Mooladhara – how to release<br>it Mother?<br>Shri Mataji: what I am saying that when you have your Mooladhara attacked in this way that it is<br>all clustered into jada. Now how to release the Mooladhara is the problem. Now the best thing<br>would be to sit on the Mother Earth when this is our Sahaja Yoga. … And you put your feet up<br>from the Mother Earth. Put your Mooladhara absolutely there and ask Mother Earth to suck<br>these problems. …<br>Then there is another way, you lie down on the Mother Earth. Lift your hands, lift your body, lift<br>your legs and just allow your Mooladhara to touch the Mother Earth, even for a short time. And<br>then try to rub it. It sucks all the problems. …<br>First of all, take a [pardon] (ask for forgiveness; ed.) that we have done these mistakes and we<br>have done in ignorance, and we have accumulated lots of inert thing. So better take them away.<br>Doctor: Another way to release jada is foot soaking, isn’t it?<br>Second Doctor: In the ocean is great.<br>Shri Mataji: Yes, but the best would be to sit in the sand, make a hole and put your feet up to this<br>much inside.<br>Jada comes from all the five elements.

Even from mana, from the mind, jada comes in.<br>1982-07-10 Derby, UK<br>61<br>Bald Heads<br>You have two types of bald heads, as I told you.

[Laughing] And [then there are] those who have both; it could be.<br>The one which starts from here (Shri Mataji points to the front of the head; ed.) are the people<br>who have got an Ekadasha [Rudra] problem also, possibly. It starts with the Ekadasha problem.<br>Or [it happens to people] who are not very collective …; it will start receding back.<br>Those [for] whom [baldness] starts from here (Shri Mataji points to the back of the head; ed.)<br>are the people who may not be good husbands, [where] maybe something is wrong with their<br>wives, maybe [they have] bad wives or the husband-wife relationship is upsetting – then this<br>starts at the back.<br>Maybe there is some incompatibility between the two or too much attachment to the wife or too<br>much attachment to the husband, then also you start developing that.<br>All these things are Left Nabhi. The Left Nabhi relationship is the Gruha Lakshmi relationship.<br>When you adore your wife so much that she is no more a Gruha Lakshmi, this also is a<br>wrong thing.<br>Also, it could be because of your hectic life. If you are very hectic in your life, you are running<br>up and down, doing too much work, then also it may start. You do not listen to your wife about<br>it and you think you have to do this [much] work, then also it might start here. (Shri Mataji puts<br>Her hand to the back of Her head; ed.). There are so many reasons for the Left Nabhi to start.<br>But the one that starts here (Shri Mataji points to Her forehead area; ed.), starts with the<br>Right Nabhi.<br>1986-01-13 Musalwadi, India<br>Darshan<br>Doctor: What is the proper attitude when we take darshan of You, Shri Mataji?<br>Shri Mataji: Oh, it is rather embarrassing. [Laughter]. All right, I will close My eyes and My face,<br>and I will tell you. [Laughter]<br>Now, supposing Christ appears before you and you know He is Christ, what will happen? That<br>should be the attitude at least, minimum. Though Christ had to manage only one chakra (Shri<br>Mataji touches Her Agnya; ed.), I have to manage seven. If that attitude develops, even thinking<br>of Me is sufficient. You have to just think of Me and your diseases will be cured. That depth has<br>to be reached. … But I am also Mahamaya.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>今天我们来介绍人体精微能量系统图。目前人类所了解的都是人体医学图，只能治疗身体，无法治疗不治之症，因为他们不明白病因，几乎所有的不治之症都是身心病。若我们了解精微能量系统图，能够去运作这个系统，几乎可以治愈所有疾病。未来专门写一篇文章来介绍医学与精微能量系统图的关系。</p><p>但今天我们谈论的不是医学，而是精微能量系统如何影响我们，又如何透过精微能量系统改善我们的身体，精神等所有不平衡，如何启发特质，获得喜乐和平安，以及实现灵性的升进。</p><p>这张图我们称之为三脉七轮图。神首先创造了宇宙大我，再根据宇宙大我创造了人类，甚至我们的大地母亲有着同样的精微能量系统，比如美国代表喉轮，而英国代表左心轮。首先我们介绍三条经脉，代表神的三种力量，也就是老子所说的三，三生万物，神透过这三种力量创造了万物。这些知识自远古时代就存在，只不过那时修行的人很少，都是导师考验门徒后秘密传授。</p><p><img src="https://p6.toutiaoimg.com/origin/pgc-image/5d99a6d744ec401ca24ce85fb60aa75a?from=pc" alt="灵性升进的基础——精微能量系统图说明"></p><h3 id="左脉—愿望的力量"><a href="#左脉—愿望的力量" class="headerlink" title="左脉—愿望的力量"></a><strong>左脉—愿望的力量</strong></h3><p>我们将图上左侧蓝色的经脉称为左脉，医学上对应左交感神经。有点类似于中国文化的阴，图上有个月亮，也可以叫月亮脉。阴阳平衡指的就是要平衡左脉和右脉，而保持在中脉。</p><p>左脉代表愿望的力量，掌管我们的愿望，情绪情感及过去，在进化过程中所有淘汰的事物都在左脉之中。偏向左脉的人容易出心理问题，性格内向，缺乏自信心，优柔寡断，情绪敏感等等。心理学研究的是左脉，而医学则研究的是右脉。所以，所有任何左脉的问题，通过洁净左脉就能恢复平衡的人格，治疗一切心理和情绪的问题。</p><h3 id="右脉—行动的力量"><a href="#右脉—行动的力量" class="headerlink" title="右脉—行动的力量"></a><strong>右脉—行动的力量</strong></h3><p>右脉也可以称为太阳脉，图上为黄色经脉，医学对应右交感神经，代表行动的力量。掌管我们的行动，思考，计划未来，也代表身体。处于右边的人一般比较强势，自我取向，未来取向，行动力强，容易暴躁发脾气。</p><h3 id="中脉—进化的力量"><a href="#中脉—进化的力量" class="headerlink" title="中脉—进化的力量"></a><strong>中脉—进化的力量</strong></h3><p>中脉代表进化的力量，我们一切进化的结果都储存在中脉。医学上对应副交感神经。中脉给予我们平衡。一般来说我们只能使用左脉或右脉的力量，比如我们做运动会令心跳加速，但中脉使心跳恢复正常的力量。中脉也代表当下，只有处于无思虑才能保持在中脉。当中脉被打开，就会给予我们消耗过度的左右两脉能量，令一个人回归平衡。我们的灵性也只能透过中脉完成进化，它是灵量的通道。</p><p><img src="https://p6.toutiaoimg.com/origin/pgc-image/2a7256dd0f704936989dcd05612c3446.png?from=pc" alt="灵性升进的基础——精微能量系统图说明"></p><p>此图为大地母亲的创造，三圈半代表了灵量</p><h3 id="灵量—我们内在的母亲"><a href="#灵量—我们内在的母亲" class="headerlink" title="灵量—我们内在的母亲"></a><strong>灵量—我们内在的母亲</strong></h3><p>灵量在我们骶骨三角骨，属于我们每个人的母亲，她是愿望的力量，神的剩余力量，一直等待被唤醒。当她被唤醒穿越上面6个轮穴，我们可以说一个人获得了灵性的觉醒。灵量会清洁我们的轮穴并启发轮穴的特质。灵量是人类突破觉醒的起点，如同种子的胚芽，只有启动胚芽才能开花结果。因此，只有唤醒灵量才能获得觉醒，没有其他途经。</p><h3 id="根轮—纯真和智慧的来源"><a href="#根轮—纯真和智慧的来源" class="headerlink" title="根轮—纯真和智慧的来源"></a><strong>根轮—纯真和智慧的来源</strong></h3><p>根轮特性是纯真，向小孩子一样天真无邪。根轮掌管我们的排泄功能，当灵量升起，便停止照顾骨盆神经丛的排泄功能，而是支撑灵量的工作。所以，根轮是灵性的根基，如同大树的根，若根轮不妥当，升进如同空中楼阁。</p><p>纯真是不可被毁灭的，只会被过度的性行为造成的乌云覆盖。透过洁净根轮，艾滋病也可以治愈。</p><p>同时根轮也是智慧的来源，没有纯真的人会做出各种荒唐的事。</p><h3 id="腹轮—创造力和美感"><a href="#腹轮—创造力和美感" class="headerlink" title="腹轮—创造力和美感"></a><strong>腹轮—创造力和美感</strong></h3><p>医学表现为主动脉神经丛。这个中心供应我们思考，计划未来所需要的能量。它能把脂肪细胞转化为脑细胞，供应大脑的需要。运动也会消耗这轮穴的能量。</p><p>此轮穴也被称为真知轮，代表上天的纯洁知识。若是被亡灵附体或跟随假导师会有左边问题，过度活跃的思维和身体会有右边的问题，尤其是肝脏。同时腹轮也带给我们美感和创造力。一般做艺术的对这个轮穴消耗比较大。</p><h3 id="脐轮—慷慨，平安与满足感"><a href="#脐轮—慷慨，平安与满足感" class="headerlink" title="脐轮—慷慨，平安与满足感"></a><strong>脐轮—慷慨，平安与满足感</strong></h3><p>医学上代表太阳神经丛，此中心供应使我们生命持续的力量。代表正法和进化，特质是慷慨和满足感。左脐轮代表家庭，家户女神，妻子照顾家庭和孩子表现的就是左脐轮特质，若一个人家庭出了问题，左脐轮就有问题。右边代表至高天后，如国母，代表公共利益，政治统治。也是财富的象征，右脐轮很好的人会赚到很多钱。</p><h3 id="幻海—导师的力量"><a href="#幻海—导师的力量" class="headerlink" title="幻海—导师的力量"></a><strong>幻海—导师的力量</strong></h3><p>又称迷幻的海洋，中间像梯子一样断开了中脉，这是人类生活在虚幻中的原因。绿色的圈，代表导师原理，原始宗师十次降世地球教导人类正法，并以十个原子价保持我们的正法，祂们都住在我们的幻海。当幻海被唤醒，我们就可以穿越迷幻的海洋到达实相。跟随假导师，违背上天的正法，负面的，不道德的人会有此轮穴的问题，同时会处在神的毁灭力量当中。若幻海被纠正，一个人自动变得有正法和道德。女神的力量保护我们的生存和健康，但导师给予我们知识，让我们真正得到成长。</p><h3 id="心轮—安全感的本质-灵的本质：真理-意识-喜乐"><a href="#心轮—安全感的本质-灵的本质：真理-意识-喜乐" class="headerlink" title="心轮—安全感的本质 灵的本质：真理-意识-喜乐"></a><strong>心轮—安全感的本质 灵的本质：真理-意识-喜乐</strong></h3><p>位于脊柱胸骨之后。十二岁之前，此中心产生抗体，保护我们免受负能量攻击。心轮中部特质，安全感，自信心和勇气。心轮左边是灵体，人的本质所在，喜乐，爱心和平安的来源，也代表母亲。右心轮则代表父亲，丈夫，责任感。</p><h3 id="喉轮—沟通与静观"><a href="#喉轮—沟通与静观" class="headerlink" title="喉轮—沟通与静观"></a><strong>喉轮—沟通与静观</strong></h3><p>掌管耳、喉、头、舌、牙等部位。此中心负责与别人的沟通能力。医学表现为头部神经丛。左喉轮代表自尊，男女分际，右边是甜美的行为和语言，中间是沟通，静观能力。自卑感，罪疚感来自左喉轮，意味着我们在犯错，可以称为罪的工价。</p><h3 id="额轮—宽恕的海洋"><a href="#额轮—宽恕的海洋" class="headerlink" title="额轮—宽恕的海洋"></a><strong>额轮—宽恕的海洋</strong></h3><p>也称为宽恕轮，在视神经丛的位置。照顾脑下垂体和松果腺，分别表现为自我和超我。耶稣掌管额轮中部，佛陀掌管右额轮的自我。当额轮被唤醒，耶稣就宽恕了我们过往所犯的罪。</p><p>额轮是一个非常大的课题，因为自我和超我封闭了头顶，令我们失去与神的连接。而我们目前对真理认知都来自于这两个气球，要认识实相，就必须超越思维的影响，这也是通过冥想进入无思虑的重要性。这两个气球令人变得愚蠢而又傲慢。自我和超我是思维的产物，所以那些思维越多，阅读越多的人自我和超我更大，而真理却在无思虑中。所以老子说：为学日益，为道日损。</p><p><img src="https://p6.toutiaoimg.com/origin/pgc-image/bb9867f282a64570b8ee388cf6f16cae?from=pc" alt="灵性升进的基础——精微能量系统图说明"></p><h3 id="顶轮—整合-千莲盛开"><a href="#顶轮—整合-千莲盛开" class="headerlink" title="顶轮—整合 千莲盛开"></a><strong>顶轮—整合 千莲盛开</strong></h3><p>有一千条神经从，就像盛开的莲花，代表整合。头部拥有其他所有轮穴的宝座。当1000条神经丛都被启发，一个人就获得了完全的觉醒，可以直接跳出轮回到达天国。</p><p>当我们启动了这个能量系统，就可以去验证所有的知识。获得觉醒的方法这里就不写了，可留言，无偿提供给需要的人。</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>关于什么是开悟或自觉，我已经在之前文章作了详细介绍。今天我们主要分享实际操作篇，真正去体验真理，获得自觉，而不是空洞的谈论理论。</p><p>如果在古代，你向人们说可以登上月球，没有人会相信，因为受限于当时的科技。在灵性领域，同样如此，10分钟获得自觉可能吗？在以前，即使你行各种苦行，无论你如何努力，都无法获得自觉。即使降世神祇也无法给予自觉，因为时机没有成熟。</p><p>但事情在1970年5月5日发生了转变，由于神的恩赐，人类的集体的顶轮被打开，这使人们大规模获得自觉成为可能。这是灵性史上最伟大的事情，过往有很多降世神祇做了无数工作才到达这个段。如同我们的科技建立在巨人的肩膀上。</p><img src="https://p6.toutiaoimg.com/origin/pgc-image/9e68871d7eb143d89679055b18b51900?from=pc" alt="10分钟获得自觉的方法（实践篇）" style="zoom:50%;" /><p>多说无益，我们还是直接进入实践篇。只有获得自觉，我们才能谈论更多深入的知识。下面的篇幅我会详细介绍实践方法和原理。关于获得自觉的基础，精微能量系统图请看之前文章。这里只介绍原理。自觉意味着个体与上天力量的连结。</p><p><strong>如何达到？所有的机制早就内置在我们的身体系统，与思维毫无关系。只需要唤醒我们图中三角骨里的灵量，当灵量上升，穿越中间的通道，刺穿顶轮，一个人开始连接到上天的力量，即宇宙大我，这就是自觉。</strong></p><p>灵量是我们内在愿望的力量，太初母性力量，她是我们每一个人的母亲，记录我们历世的一切。她一直等待被唤醒，给予我们自觉。她一直在沉睡，如同种子的胚芽，一旦胚芽被唤醒，种子才会开花结果，这就是重生。若一个人没有自觉，我们内在所有力量都无法表达。</p><p>所以，我们必须拥有纯洁的愿望去获取，否则她不会起作用。当我们去做事，首先产生的是欲望，然后才做出行动，对吧？</p><p>在准备唤醒灵量，我们需要做一些准备。首先找一个比较安静，不受干扰的地方。然后脱掉鞋子和袜子，坐在地上。因为我们的鞋子和袜子都是人工化的物品，会隔绝与大地母亲能量流通，大地母亲可以帮助我们吸走不好的能量，帮助我们获得自觉。</p><p>然后我们有一些手部动作，都发生在左侧，因为左脉是我们愿望的力量，而右脉属于行动的力量，我们用右手去做出行动。然后透过一些确认语句或口诀，去打开我们的轮穴，这样灵量才有通道上升。在整个过程中，不要思考，用心去做，因为思维会阻碍额轮。建议可以使用霎哈嘉瑜伽创始人玛塔吉的照片，因为幻海的悬梯需要通过真导师的力量填充，后面附图。同时可以点上一根蜡烛，火元素对左脉很有帮助，而光元素则对额轮有帮助，同时可以燃烧一些负面能量。</p><p>最后，我必须强调一点，不要认为自己做了什么，神才是做事者。比如：当你吃了食物，不是你在消化食物，而是你的胃。在整个过程中，最好保持无思虑，用心去做。若没有获得自觉，可以试图多做几次，因为有的人轮穴被破坏的很严重。</p><p><img src="https://p6.toutiaoimg.com/origin/pgc-image/e6e04509ca3c48d59ec5d25d59d958d9?from=pc" alt="10分钟获得自觉的方法（实践篇）"></p><p>第一步中，左心轮是我们的灵体所在。第二步中，左上腹是导师原理的能量中心，我们可以问这几个问题。整个过程，我们把注意力放在内在，闭上眼睛。</p><p><img src="https://p6.toutiaoimg.com/origin/pgc-image/c977f405e21c432abcb7fa6ba78ff63f?from=pc" alt="10分钟获得自觉的方法（实践篇）"></p><p>第三步，右手放在左下腹，这是上天纯洁知识的能量中心，6次确认语句，因为这个轮穴有6块花瓣。第四部是导师的能量中心，原始宗师主要以10个形相降世，建立我们的幻海。在中国，老子和孔子都是原始宗师的化身。</p><p><img src="https://p6.toutiaoimg.com/origin/pgc-image/19d3e3b635b9455794313ee93964a152?from=pc" alt="10分钟获得自觉的方法（实践篇）"></p><p>心轮有12块花瓣，所以用心去说12次，为了唤醒我们内在的灵，灵是我们的本质所在，神的反应。</p><p><img src="https://p6.toutiaoimg.com/origin/pgc-image/71dcaab802c2416db60460b1d4778c2b?from=pc" alt="10分钟获得自觉的方法（实践篇）"></p><p>第六步，我们用右手按住左喉轮，用心说16次，我没有罪疚感。因为罪疚感会导致这个轮穴罪恶，只是用心去说，会起作用，打开这轮穴通道。</p><p><img src="https://p6.toutiaoimg.com/origin/pgc-image/7f44022427da496baf91516ef7957e20?from=pc" alt="10分钟获得自觉的方法（实践篇）"></p><p>第八步，右手放在我们后额轮，我们枕头的地方，头微微向上仰，这里，我们要寻求神的宽恕。</p><p>第九步，我们请求上天给予我们自觉。我们的右手按住头部脑囱的位置，同时顺时针用掌心旋转头皮，令头骨软化，同时使用确认语句作出请求。</p><p><img src="https://p6.toutiaoimg.com/origin/pgc-image/ee45ff2286c74517a8f754ecd42343ba?from=pc" alt="10分钟获得自觉的方法（实践篇）"></p><img src="https://p6.toutiaoimg.com/origin/pgc-image/ecf86b630c7c414fb58483c774672bb1?from=pc" alt="10分钟获得自觉的方法（实践篇）" style="zoom:50%;" /><p>​                                               霎哈嘉瑜伽创始人玛塔吉，给予成千上万人自觉</p><p>现在，我们可以将手放在头顶上方，离头更高的位置，去感应是否有热风和凉风从头顶渗透出来，然后注意力放在头顶静坐一会。看看手上是否有凉风和热风。热风代表阻塞，凉风代表轮穴较好，手指可能会有麻和胀，或微痛的感觉，那是轮穴阻塞的原因，每个手指都对应不同的轮穴。一旦感觉到新的知觉，恭喜你，获得了自觉。</p><p>获得自觉只是灵性的起始点，我们只是打开了顶轮，取得与上天力量的合一。我们先打开顶部，然后需要透过上天的力量来打地基。种子发芽了，还需要水和阳光才能开花结果，对吧！下方轮穴会有阻塞，需要通过适当的方法去洁净，更多的唤醒轮穴的神祇和特质，好使更多的灵量上升，灵量可以纠正我们所有轮穴的不平衡，表现在外在，我们的情绪，健康，精神和物质等一切都会改善。</p><p>自觉后我们需要恒常的练习入静，巩固自觉，否则顶轮可能再次关闭。自觉的好处，我们还是用一篇文章再详细介绍。毕竟，若没有极大的好处，我们为什么去追寻呢？之后我们再介绍如何冥想，如何平衡能量系统等。</p>]]></content>

Always<br>seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health care provider with any questions you may have<br>regarding a medical condition or treatment and before undertaking a new health care regime. Never disregard<br>professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of information you have read in this booklet.<br>The treatments described work on a subtle level and are based on experience and partially on Ayurvedic<br>traditions. These methods cannot always be proved effective by the academic medicine of today.<br>In case of pain, ailments, mental or psychic problems appearing during a treatment, it should be terminated;<br>in case of need a physician should be consulted.<br>On the Occasion of Sahasrara Day 2022<br>“You have to keep the temple of God healthy and happy.” Shri Mataji’s words emphasize the ancient<br>message of integration of all aspects of existence, but here is a decisive difference. She has<br>actually enabled the seekers ‘to know Thy Self’, that is to experience and enjoy the spiritual reality.<br>By granting the experience of Self-realisation a quantum jump in our awareness is made possible,<br>giving rise to thoughtless awareness – the meditative witness state. We are able to feel love<br>flowing through our hearts and perceive the all-pervading energy. The latter is referred to as<br>‘vibratory awareness’ or simply ‘vibrations’, in order to attune ancient vocabulary to a modern<br>global language.<br>Why is this important for matters of health? Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji’s method of en-masse<br>Self-realisation, gives us an added ‘sixth sense’ in the detection, understanding and tackling of<br>imbalances and shortcomings in our mental, emotional and physical beings. Naturally, keen<br>medical doctors have systematically tested the claim on a scientific basis and with outstanding<br>success. The information presented here has not been ‘learned’ but is innate knowledge coming<br>from direct experience. Following Shri Mataji’s words, the content of this book can be compared<br>to reading a recipe – it is not the medicine itself. The medicine is to develop the state of meditation,<br>the inner yoga. In other words, the methods described are ‘state-specific’,<br>they work only after Self-realisation.<br>It is seen as good practice to give a brief explanation of the nature of Shri Mataji’s recorded talks.<br>Many of them used for this publication occurred in a very informal setting, for example in hands-<br>on workshops, living room conversations, medical discussions and live media interviews. There<br>She dealt with immediate health issues, intellectual inquiries and spiritual needs of the people<br>around Her and encouraged them to practice on the spot what they had just learned.

This side needs cooling. This is the basics.”<br>4<br>The Experience<br>Till the Kundalini has not broken the brahmarandhra, you cannot feel the cool breeze. … It is<br>absolutely spontaneous. If your heart is clean it will break, if your heart is strong it will break,<br>but if you have a weak heart it will not break. If you are suffering from a heart trouble, it will not<br>break.<br>1983-02-04 New Delhi, India<br>You have to get your vibrations in your hands to begin with. Some people who have had<br>problems with their hands, because of previous life or some sort of a thing, they feel their<br>chakras in their own places. Then after some time, you will start feeling your chakras in your<br>brain. After that you need not feel the chakras at all. You just say, “This is it”. Finished!<br>1983-02-02 New Delhi, India<br>How do you feel vibrations? When do you feel vibrations? How do you lose vibrations?<br>What happens? All those things are just within yourself.<br>Of course, after some time, we might be able to say what behavioural changes one should take.<br>But you can find out yourself, if you want to find out – what is right and what is wrong and what<br>is to be done to keep up the vibrations.<br>But vibrations are, in one way, extremely charitable, very charitable things. Even if you do a little<br>wrong, they may not disappear that moment, but you will get a feeling within yourself that this<br>is wrong. After some time you will find, it will show that you have no vibrations and you would<br>not know that you have no vibrations! So, the first principle of sahaj dharma, or what you call<br>Vishwa Nirmala Dharma, is that you should be able to keep up your vibrations going as they are<br>or increase them or improve on their sensitivity. The more sensitive you are, the better you are.<br>If the sensitivity is lacking then one must say that Sahaja Yoga has failed in you so far, and you<br>have to work it out.<br>1985-08-06 London, UK<br>I will tell you a simple thing: This left hand is ‘minus’, and this [right hand] is ‘plus’. Whatever<br>you do with the left hand, you suck in. Whatever you do with the right hand, you give out. …<br>This [left] side needs heat. This [right] side needs cooling. This is the basics. If something wrong<br>with this [right] side, you have to give it the cool. If something wrong this [left] side, you have to<br>give it the heat.<br>1980-05-17.2 Old Alresford, UK<br>As an example, if you want to correct a liver which is overheated, you put the left hand on the<br>liver, and the right hand outside. You are taking the heat from the liver and giving it out with<br>the right hand.<br>1980-05-17.2 Old Alresford, UK<br>5<br>Depending on the quality of your centers, the chakras, they are the ones who really are the<br>channels for the energy of God to flow in. Regarding them, you have to be careful, how your<br>chakras are. Are you clean or not? Some of you will find a cool breeze flowing all right in the<br>hand, but maybe, one chakra is catching. On one chakra you will feel the heat, or you may feel<br>the numbness. You might feel also a kind of a, we can say, tingling on certain fingers.<br>Wherever there is tingling, you must know there is a kind of a struggle going on between those<br>chakras and the Kundalini. You should just try to help your chakras, to awaken them. Also, you<br>must know that every one of you is part and parcel of the whole. You are awakened now; you are<br>awakened to that part and so you have to be more careful.<br>1983-03-20 Sydney, Australia<br>The right side is heat, it is the Surya Nadi. When you have problem of Surya Nadi …<br>to neutralize it, you have to use something else [than fire].<br>You can take the name of Chandra and you will cool down. If the left side is catching, then you<br>have to take the name of Surya.<br>1980-05-17.2 Old Alresford, UK<br>For the right-sidedness, you can use the Mother Earth. Mother Earth is the best, or water and<br>salt. Water and salt are very good for people who are suffering from over-activity.<br>Now how do you do it? It is good for both [left- and right-sided], but specially for them [on the<br>right side]. You have to put both the hands first towards the photograph and put both the feet in<br>the water, with a bit of salt.<br>If you are feeling the vibrations coming in both the hands, equally the same, it is all right, you do<br>not have to worry. But supposing, one hand is more, and one hand is less [sensitive]? The hand<br>that is less has to go towards the photograph and the other one has to go out.<br>And you will be amazed. You will feel within yourself these balloons [of ego and superego]<br>moving; … you are getting relaxed.<br>1983-03-20 Sydney, Australia<br>For people who suffer from Ego, the best thing is to put your hands into the ice, the right hand<br>maybe. …<br>For people who suffer from Super Ego, a little bit of burning your hand in the candle may help,<br>just try.<br>Either you are a ‘frozen’ personality, or you are a ‘heated’ personality, you are not in the center.<br>If you are a frozen personality, better melt it a little bit. But do not burn it to have blisters! Just a<br>little bit, try to see – the sensitivity will improve.<br>1982-11-26 London, UK<br>6<br>Some things like clay is cool, it should be used for the right side, for the liver. … There are many<br>things which in effect are heat, they are good for the left side. For example, you can use light and<br>the sun. But for the right side you use water or ice.<br>Gradually you will know everything. Because you have got your Kundalini in your head, it will<br>give you all the light and you know all the knowledge.<br>1991-08-24 Moscow, Russia<br>Liver<br>How do we know which one [liver] is cold and which one is lethargic?<br>On vibrations you will know. There are symptoms connected with liver. ‘Cold’ must be an<br>enlarged liver, and ‘hot’ is contracted. For the liver, best is to look after the one which is heated<br>up, because it creates all the problems.<br>If it is enlarged, also you can reduce it by eating something like chana. … But not [food] which<br>can enlarge it, like rice can enlarge, then carbohydrates.<br>Also, what you have is milk, … milk gives you heat. There are so many things we take, which can<br>enlarge the thing [liver]. People who eat too much of sugar – that can enlarge it, because you<br>give sugar for a hot liver. Sugar we [only] give for a hot liver as a treatment.<br>2000-09-01 London, UK<br>This liver has a special capacity to extract all the poisons from the body as heat. And the heat<br>in the body is to be conveyed to the blood and that has to be taken out of the body, maybe as<br>perspiration or in other forms.<br>But what happens when this liver is out of gear? It cannot pass this heat into the blood stream<br>and the heat remains in the body and you become heated up. That makes all these problems<br>for you.<br>Those people who have a bad liver feel a little heat when the Kundalini rises.<br>1982-05-14 Brighton, UK<br>Some of you might start feeling hot in the hands. If so, you can just throw it away. Those who<br>are feeling the left hand hot should put your right hand on the heart. Those who are feeling hot<br>in the right hand, then you put your left hand on the liver, just below the ribs and right hand<br>towards me.<br>1979-05-24 London, UK<br>Liver trouble is another thing, you yourself do not feel. Others know you are liverish, the way<br>you are hot tempered, fussy and snarl at people. You are never satisfied with anything and you<br>criticise others. All this is liverish. Such liverish people are never happy with themselves.<br>7<br>The liver looks after your attention and those who have liver problems, their attention is horrid.<br>Their eyes are going this way, that way. Their attention is wobbly.<br>1982-05-14 Brighton, UK<br>A person who thinks too much, plans too much and thinks he is responsible for the whole world<br>affairs, in this myth develops his ego to a great extent. He uses his right-side Swadhisthan too<br>much by which his left side suffers too much and then he develops all the problems of the left<br>side in the organs.<br>First of all, the Swadhisthan cannot look after the liver, so he develops a [hot] liver. The liver<br>gives us the ego part. Lakshmana looks after the liver and destroys the ego.<br>1986-12-23 Nashik, India<br>Food<br>Any kind of food you eat has to be suitable for your temperament, your prakriti. It has to<br>be suitable.<br>Supposing you are a very right-sided person, then it is better for you to take more to<br>carbohydrates. But if you are a left-sided person, then is better for you to take to proteins.<br>There is no hard and fast rule about it. It has to be complementary to your nature. That is how<br>we decide. Every individual has a different temperament, and accordingly, we have to decide<br>what sort of food one should take.<br>1990-03-16 Sydney, Australia<br>All these things are meant either for the right side or for the left side, even food. They have<br>left- or right- [side] effects. Say, the sour fruits, we can call them the citrus fruit, like this<br>(Shri Mataji points to a type of plums; ed.), they are for the right side.<br>1991-08-24 Moscow, Russia<br>Right-sided people should have more carbohydrates, while the vegetarians should take more<br>proteins, but not animals which are bigger than you. If they do not like meat take to other<br>proteins, because proteins are very important.<br>1982-11-26 London, UK<br>If you want to reduce the activity of the [hot] liver, then you take sugar or carbohydrates. …<br>If you do not have protein in your food, the liver will become lethargic, weak and lethargic.<br>1982-10-13 London, UK<br>Right-sided people should take to foods which are left-sided, that is carbohydrates — means<br>they should become partly vegetarians, or quite a lot vegetarian — and should eat things at the<br>most like chicken, but neither fish nor seafoods, because they are all hot.<br>1983-01-21 Vaitharna, India<br>8<br>You have to take carbohydrates to neutralize that heat. If you do not like sugar, eat rice.<br>1981-10-18 Santa Cruz, CA, USA<br>We should not eat food immediately from the oven; sizzling food you should not eat. Let your<br>juices flow out to digest it and then eat it, otherwise you will burn your tongue or palate. Best is<br>to keep a tepid understanding of food, like water should not be very hot, food should not be<br>very hot.<br>After eating ice, they will have something hot suddenly, after that, or before … that is the worst<br>of all.<br>1982-01-25 Lonavala, India<br>After taking anything fried you should not take water or after eating fruit you should not take<br>water. You can take a biscuit or bread, something like that to dry up your throat, and then you<br>can take water. Sauces are very important for use with food to prevent drying of the membranes<br>of the throat.<br>1984-10-05 London, UK<br>Vegetarians can be very left-sided. They eat too much rice. It is just carbohydrates, is all starch<br>and vegetables, potatoes. All these things cause lethargy to the left side.<br>Dr. Rustom: Protein digestion starts up in the stomach and then it carries on in the<br>smaller intestines.<br>Shri Mataji continues: … and liver. That is the food for liver, no doubt. Though it does not take<br>part in the digestion, it uses the carbohydrates in the body. The liver is the only organ in the body<br>that can burn fat. It transforms it. Also, it removes the poison.<br>Now, if you take the cirrhosis case in India, it is because of the eating habits. You will always find<br>the vegetarians are eating nothing than starch, rice, potatoes. If you eat too much of these things,<br>the liver then will be starved. If you give sugar to the liver, then also the liver will<br>become lethargic.<br>1982-10-13 London, UK<br>If you do not have protein in your food, the liver will become lethargic and weak. When it<br>becomes weak then you get cirrhosis.<br>1982-10-13 London, UK<br>Science<br>Treatment according to personality and temperament. They are not bothered; they do not<br>understand these things. They just experiment, medical science is such a new science. Whatever<br>we have in our country [of India] is through the experimenting side. And secondly, we built all<br>our discovery on the experimentation on human beings as such and on basics like trigunatmika<br>and triguna. All the medicines are based on that.<br>9<br>The same approach was in the western culture. But they could not go very far with it. They gave<br>it up and they started a more symptom-wise [approach]. Whatever are your symptoms, the<br>symptoms are to be cured. But you do not take the whole into account.<br>That means there are three types of people and they have three problems. They are treated<br>accordingly. Then the balance is brought in.<br>For example, the person who is a Sahaja Yogini becomes a thin person. And the person who is on<br>the left side becomes a fatter person. And the central one is the one who has more of gas.<br>You do not have that gas system? And when the permutations and combinations of these go out of<br>balance, any imbalance is not good for health. It is not how you look. You hear from everybody,<br>‘if he looks bony, then he is healthy’.<br>But in India, maybe a bony person is a tubercular patient. Or a fat person is unhealthy, but<br>maybe the fat person may ascend. Maybe the person is having the sattwa guna. In India, [any<br>assessment] is done according to the personality and the person’s temperament. All these things<br>have to be taken into account.<br>Say, a man who will do too much of mental work – they will prescribe a diet which will consist<br>of more carbohydrate. They are not bothered about how you look, because nobody is going to<br>become a cinema actor. So many inches of waist and so many inches of neck and all that – it is<br>very outside.<br>A woman has to be left-sided. She has to be fatter, much fatter than man. She has to bear<br>children. Even in animal kingdom if you see, all the females have lots of fat. They have to have<br>fat because they have to sustain the child – they have to work for the child. If you find a western<br>girl, she is so thin, and she has children, she has to do household work and all that. Then she<br>becomes crazy. That is why she cannot love her children, because she becomes crazy. There is<br>no stored energy.<br>And the tensions are so great in the west, too many tensions for nothing at all, it is very artificial.<br>1984-09-06 Vienna, Austria<br>Sahaja Yoga gives you the complete picture of the totality of consciousness. As you grow higher<br>and higher in Sahaja Yoga you yourself understand and can work out this great system.<br>First, we have to accept that we are not only this human body; we are neither emotions, nor are<br>we ego and conditionings, but we are the pure Spirit. One other thing that we have to understand,<br>that there is an all-pervading power of Love which does all this living work of creating flowers,<br>fruits and making us human beings.<br>Of course, in science they do not talk of love but even the doctors have to love the patients,<br>otherwise they cannot dedicate themselves.<br>10<br>First the doctor has to become the Spirit. He has to feel the cool vibrations on his head which are<br>the fruit of this all-pervading power of love. This is the instrument which you have to use, first of<br>all for cleansing yourself and for cleansing others.<br>In the medical terminology we can say that the parasympathetic system is looked after by the<br>central channel and the left and right [sympathetic nervous system] are looked after by two<br>more channels [of Ida and Pingala Nadi].<br>1990-07-02 Moscow, Russia<br>We have to be discreet; we have to understand who needs what. Everybody does not need to take<br>vegetarian food. Everybody does not need to take non-vegetarian food. It is the prakriti they call<br>it, the nature of a person. You must find out what is the nature of the person.<br>If he is suffering from high blood pressure and things like that, he has to take to food which will<br>give him another ‘side’ – means he should stop eating meat and similar things. So, he balances<br>himself.<br>The whole food theory is to be understood through the understanding of your being first of all,<br>what sort of a being you are, and what is lacking in you is to be supplemented.<br>We just cannot say, like so many people and doctors do now, “cut down your sugar”, in general.<br>It is absurd. Sugar is very important for the liver. If you do not take sugar, I do not know what<br>will happen to you. You will become like sticks, absolutely like sticks.<br>If those people who are right-sided do not take sugar at all, I do not know what is going to<br>happen to them. They will be very irritable, hot-tempered, absolutely stick-like people. …<br>What is the science behind it? Carbohydrates are very important for the body, especially if you are<br>thinking too much, if you are a futuristic person. If you are right-sided, it is absolutely essential<br>that you must have sufficient carbohydrates. We have treated so many liver patients with sugar. …<br>I must say that doctors should not feel hurt but is a very general statement doctors make. …<br>Now you all should stop sugars? Why? Our forefathers ate sugar. They were healthier people than<br>us, I tell you.<br>1983-03-08 Melbourne, Australia<br>In Western science there is nothing for cooling. In Ayurveda they have some things, not many,<br>but we have. So, they go on heating up – and heated up and heated up, even the brain gets heated<br>up, everybody gets heated up … even the nerves get heated up … and you have no strength left to<br>fight any illness. …<br>But medical studies help you a lot to understand the physical help of Sahaja Yoga. You do not<br>have to go for diagnosis, when the patient dies half-way when he is diagnosed by the time.<br>The best is to diagnose a person on your fingers, which is absolute knowledge, absolute.<br>1995-08-02 Bucharest, Romania<br>11<br>“My preparation is that I first give you Realisation. … Now your preparation should be<br>to use this awareness all the time.”<br>Diseases &amp; Remedies<br>from A – Z<br>12<br>Aids<br>A simple thing I had requested you all, is to put some ghee in the nose, which is a very simple<br>thing but is very important. You all suffer from a very bad Hamsa [Chakra], and one of the<br>things that is a symptom in an AIDS case is a bad Hamsa. You will be vulnerable to AIDS – and<br>a small thing like that is not observed.<br>1987-05-03 Thredbo, Australia<br>It is caused by the copper in the blood. … This virus is carried by the copper in the body. If you<br>can neutralize the copper in the body through some gold – in India, we have methods of making<br>gold soluble.

To take coffee and then immediately take cold water. This sudden change is<br>what the system cannot adjust to. In the Left Nabhi area is the spleen. The spleen is a speedometer<br>and also an adjuster. When it adjusts and it is not properly done due to sudden change, it causes<br>problem. It has to suddenly provide its energies to either increase or decrease the flow of RBCs<br>(Red Blood Cells; ed.).<br>1987-02-27 Mumbai, India<br>Cow milk always gives you the left side because she is the ‘mother’.

Any type of attack or fear is<br>communicated by this sternum bone which starts pulsating.<br>1989-10-23 Kiev, Ukraine<br>This center is very important because until the age of twelve years, this center creates in the<br>sternum bone the antibodies, which are then circulated throughout the whole body and they are<br>under the remote control of the sternum. Whenever one feels frightened or under attack, this<br>sternum bone starts pulsating and giving messages to the antibodies, which are called ganas in<br>Sanskrit. These antibodies fight the disease or the attacker. The center heart in the central position<br>is the one for our immune system. When we commit ‘Sins against the Primordial Mother’, that is,<br>indulging in wrong type of perverted sex habits, alcohol, drugs, internal stress from anxiety and<br>fear of oppression, then this center goes into jeopardy, making our immune system weak, thereby<br>losing its power to help fight the diseases of the person.<br>Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi: Meta Modern Era. 1995<br>The chakra of Jagadamba has been made here. This matter can be medically explained in this<br>15<br>manner that our sternum bone is in the heart, and in this bone, Jagadamba, who is also called<br>Brahmaramba, makes brahmar which is called antibodies in science. They are germinated here.<br>When there is any attack, then they are capable of inflicting total defeat by fighting. This sternum<br>bone develops up to twelve years of age. Later, it spreads in the whole body.<br>As soon as any danger is seen, immediately this [information] starts going up and down. The<br>message reaches those antibodies and they get ready. After getting ready, they fight and win. They<br>keep on fighting. As long as any trouble is there for the human being, the brahmar of the Devi<br>keep fighting. This is the arrangement made by Devi for us.<br>1986-04-02 Kolkata, India<br>Arthritis<br>Arthritis is a left-side problem.<br>1983-02-09 New Delhi, India<br>If you take your bath and get out of your bath (in the cold; ed.), you are definite to catch these<br>troubles in the chest.

This comes from the Mother Earth. You can also use the<br>mantra for the Mother Earth.<br>Doctor: Shri Mataji, why is it that your own antibodies harm you?<br>Shri Mataji: No, what happens is you have low level of calcium, and with that your bones become<br>like that. There are two types of arthritis. In one there is too much calcium, and in the other<br>there is a deficiency of calcium. [The one] which pains a lot, is gout.<br>Doctor: Osteoarthritis!<br>Shri Mataji: Yes, one that pains. There is a terrible pain all the time, on legs, on knees and so on.<br>16<br>… The painful [type] is due to calcium deficiency. …<br>And the other one you have [where you get crippled], is due to too much of calcium. In medical<br>science there is no differentiation. You do not have the same treatment for all. A person who has<br>pain should take phosphorus. I have written about phosphorus. Phosphorus gives you heat [and<br>with that heat] it improves. And the other one is due to over-calcium.<br>Doctor: Shri Mataji, in what form should we take phosphorus?<br>Shri Mataji: [Take] phosphorus itself. … [Also] in certain salts there is phosphorus. They also<br>take seaweed; that has phosphorus. But it gets cured just by meditating. … The another one is<br>difficult [to treat].<br>2000-09-01 London, UK<br>Asthma<br>You get asthma if your Right Heart is caught [up].

Cancer is a psychosomatic disease and that might be the<br>reason it might cause, in a very far-fetched way, cancer too. If it is too cold, then you go to the left<br>side and on the left side you can catch the viruses by which you can get into troubles.<br>But the same lead-oxide is all right for people who are very right-sided.

Or any problem,<br>that comes through the generations?<br>Shri Mataji: The problems are like this. There is only one center which covers all the seven<br>centers, which is the Mooladhara – because it is the omkara, it is the chaitanya. The<br>Mooladhara is insulted if there is an incest relationship and the family grows, then it [the<br>impact] is [lasting for] seven generations.<br>But, if it is between a very holy relationship like mother and a son or something like that, then it<br>lasts for fourteen generations.<br>It is a complete insult of Shri Ganesh.

It is<br>where you get troubles like sinus, colds and coughs, and they can result from the drying up of<br>the nose because of the use of central heating. Just leave some water or liquid or fill a tub in the<br>bath and keep it open so there is humidity in the room.<br>1982-01-25 Lonavala, India<br>… due to this dryness. I think, in the room there is dryness, in the places where you work there<br>is dryness and in the house is dryness. You must use this ghee for the nose.

So, you should take water after<br>some carbohydrates. You can take some papad, but not a fried one. You take anything fried, on<br>top of that you are not to take water. You can take a biscuit or have a bread, something like that<br>to dry up [your throat]. Best is chana. Dry up your throat and then take water.<br>Heat and cold – say, you take coffee and then take water. This is absolutely wrong. You should<br>take water, then gradually heated up and take coffee last. Then do not take water till you have<br>taken some carbohydrates. … The combination of heat and cold should be understood.<br>Now what do you do? Actually, you neglect certain laws of nature. Like in London or anywhere, it<br>is all heated up inside the rooms and it is very dry. You have to have a humidifier or keep some<br>water or some liquid or fill a tub in the bathroom and keep it open so that there is humidity<br>in the room. To compensate for all that one could take some water and sip in the nose. After<br>brushing your teeth, sip it thrice and thrice you take it out. By putting these fingers, these thumbs<br>in your ears and take it out. By that you will clear out your sinuses, you will make it humid.<br>For these parched mucus membranes, you can put some oil or some ghee. If this water can have<br>a little bit of salt, that is a good idea.

Now, the Divine vibration flows within us when we get our Self-<br>realization. Before that we are cut off from our Spirit.<br>The Spirit resides in our heart and our attention is not enlightened by that Spirit. The Spirit<br>watches us like a witness, … but the Kundalini, … the reflection of the Holy Ghost which<br>resides in the triangular bone, records everything that we do. It is just like a tape-recorder. …<br>It is a subtler knowledge; for that we have to extend ourselves. …<br>Our subtle being remains working as Parasympathetic Nervous System. This Parasympathetic<br>Nervous System is a system within us which nourishes us, gives us balance and repairs us just<br>like a fountain of every energy, but that too has limited energy. We use the Sympathetic Nervous<br>System when we have any emergencies – as we run fast and the heart can start pumping very<br>fast. When we relax, the heart comes back to its own position. That happens through the<br>Parasympathetic Nervous System. But it has a limited energy and that is how diseases are caused,<br>because we exhaust our limited energies due to some reason.<br>We have three powers within us. One of them is the left-hand side power of desire, the second<br>power is the right-hand side power of action and the central power of our evolution. The left-<br>hand side power is manifested in the gross as Left Sympathetic Nervous System, the right-hand<br>side is manifested within us as the Right Sympathetic Nervous System and the central one as the<br>Parasympathetic – so in the gross we call them by these names.<br>At the human stage when we [evolve], we start balancing ourselves by trial and error. … We go<br>from one extreme to another extreme, then we try to come to the center and when we come to<br>the center, that is the time our ascent takes place.<br>The left represents our past and the right represents our future, so we have to be in the present.<br>We have to be there, but we cannot.

We cannot feel it within<br>ourselves because we live in the past or in the future.<br>When this Kundalini rises, she elongates those thoughts and by that elongation the gap between<br>the two thoughts increases and we become thoughtlessly aware.<br>1984-07-26 Hove, UK<br>Cancer and the Collective Subconsciousness<br>As I told you yesterday, with ‘effort’ you go in the wrong direction – either you move to the left<br>side or to the right side. When you move to the left side, what happens, you get ‘caught up’.<br>51<br>You get ‘caught up’ because on the left side all your collective consciousness is there. Cancer is<br>caused by negativities – that is the one [factor] that triggers [it].<br>I saw a television show in which the doctors were telling people that the vulnerability of the<br>cancer is first established when the sympathetic [nervous system] is too active. You become<br>vulnerable but triggering takes place with some proteins called ‘protein 58’ and ‘protein 52’.<br>[The doctors] they give just names.<br>They attack you and the triggering comes from the area, which is built within us since our<br>creation, the ‘Collective Subconscious’. Unless and until you get ‘caught up’ by something, cancer<br>cannot be triggered, though we are vulnerable every moment because we are so much on the<br>sympathetic. All the time we are in emergency.<br>… This ‘Collective Subconscious’ is existing within us since our creation. If you start moving too<br>much into it, when you bow to someone and submit to someone and that guru is an expert on<br>all these things, which we call in Sanskrit language as preta vidya or shmashana vidya. It is the<br>knowledge of the dead. Then they can entice you, they can mesmerise you, they can ask you to<br>kill yourself, they can do what they like. They will say, “Go and destroy yourself”. You have heard<br>of such cases where people have destroyed themselves. … But we must use our intelligence to<br>understand that, “Are we to destroy ourselves now?”.<br>1984-07-26 Hove, UK<br>What is a difference between a baddha and a bhoot?

If it is in the liver, this baddha may come<br>in the center and then it will start moving from here to here as the Kundalini will move. But a<br>baddha does not have its [own] arbitrary movement. As you move the Kundalini, the baddha<br>moves. Baddha means the ‘hindrance’.<br>But a bhoot is arbitrary. It moves; it will be one moment here; it will be one moment there. It will<br>move this side and that side. It will go to the Right Heart, then it will come to the Left Heart. If it<br>shows an arbitrary behaviour, that means it is not controlled by your movement of your fingers<br>through the Kundalini awakening, then you must know it is a bhoot.<br>You can say, if there is some lump in the body, it may start moving with the bloodstream, some<br>force is acting upon it. But by itself, it does not move. But if there is a worm, it will move by itself.<br>1980-05-17.2 Alresford, UK<br>It is only through Sahaja Yoga you can understand what lies in that brain.<br>All the seven centres about which I have told you in the previous lectures lie above this area.<br>52<br>To begin with the Mooladhara, it lies in the centre of your – at this point where the bone [at the<br>back of the head] is jetting out. I do not want to use medical terminology, because some people<br>told me they cannot understand it. Around that moves this Swadhisthana Chakra.<br>You must have seen people who suffer from diabetes they always lose their eye sight. The eye<br>sight is first affected when they have diabetics trouble. What is the reason?<br>The reason is, the Swadhisthana is in the stomach and the pitha or you can say the ‘seat’ of that<br>Swadhisthana Chakra is here at the back of your head, where the lobes which supply the energy<br>to the eyes is seated. Around that moves the Swadhisthana.<br>In the centre is the Mooladhara and around that moves the Swadhisthana, which is responsible<br>for this over activity. When we think too much, it is over active and the conversion of the fat cells<br>from the stomach to the brain is done in such a fast speed. When we think too much, we are<br>futuristic so that all other organs are neglected.<br>Such a Swadhisthana, which gets hectic, which does not understand what to do, now gets out of<br>gear. Because of that, one of the organs, the pancreas, gets no energy from the Swadhisthan. It<br>gets out of order and you develop diabetics. If anything goes wrong with the Swadhisthana, it<br>spoils the ‘seat’ of the Swadhisthana [moving] around the Mooladhara, which is in the center.<br>By that you get your eyes blinded, because it is pushing down the Mooladhara, which is in<br>its center. There is no use treating the eyes. The best is to treat your Mooladhara or treat<br>your Swadhisthana because the Swadhisthana is absolutely augmenting the movement of the<br>Mooladhara, which has to support the optic lobe.<br>It is so important to keep our mental being very sensible and balanced. It is very important. This<br>is only about one chakra, I have told you, but all the seven chakras lie above the limbic area.<br>1984-03-20 Delhi, India<br>Diseases caused by neglect of Mooladhara<br>Doctor: Multiple sclerosis, Shri Mataji, … it affects the nerves. The fat around the nerves<br>is finished.<br>Shri Mataji: I know, I have cured multiple sclerosis. The hands and legs become like this –<br>they stumble.<br>One thing I have seen is very surprising: if one of the two, husband and wife, is ‘caught up’ –<br>then the husband gets it if the wife is ‘caught up’, or if the husband is ‘caught up’, the wife gets it.<br>[This happens] when the Mooladhara gets a baddha.<br>Doctor: Shri Mataji, Left or Right Mooladhara?<br>Shri Mataji: It is left, son. You know, because if the husband is ‘caught up’, he is not all right,<br>53<br>he is left-sided, so the wife gets it, not the husband.<br>Whenever I ask them, “How is your wife?” or “How is your husband?”, it acts on the Mooladhara.<br>… You should treat the wife or the husband; … you can use chillies for the negativity.<br>There are many diseases you get out of negativity, which doctors are not sort of aware of it.<br>To be ‘caught up’ itself is a disease. Sometimes they get a bulge here, the skin bulges out like<br>that – then there is a negativity. All around the Agnya you get bulges like that – it is one of<br>the symptoms.<br>If it is a very extreme case, then you can make it out that it is a negativity when they start shaking<br>before My photograph, and shouting, screaming and all that. … Also, a person who has a<br>negativity is dull, but otherwise aggressive. … They are mostly overly aggressive on sexuality and<br>they are wayward. … They have roving eyes – but even a slight negativity can do that. They are<br>very fond of women and can create problems.<br>But the problem is the Mooladhara. The Mooladhara is such a great thing, it supports your<br>nervous system and also supports your muscular system.<br>They have been cured; multiple sclerosis has been cured in Sahaja Yoga. You must do worship of<br>Ganesha. Also, you can use [the smoke from ajwain], like as you use it for cold.<br>These days it is very common for human beings to be wayward, because the whole atmosphere is<br>like that. They’re talking about it all the time.<br>The trouble is, the one who is ‘caught up’ does not suffer; whosoever is married to a ‘caught up’<br>person gets it.<br>AIDS is a Mooladhara problem. The Mooladhara has countless problems. The Mooladhara must<br>be kept very much safe and honoured. The marriage is a sanctity, and one should live with<br>that sanctity.<br>But even women have so many diseases. If they go round with other women and all that, they can<br>catch [all these other diseases]; they all come from these bad women. [The diseases caused by<br>Mooladhara], all of them come from bad women. The whole culture is so bad that we are in for<br>trouble. Men want to have always a younger woman; so, one is discarded, then the second one is<br>discarded, like that it goes on.<br>2000-09-01 London, UK<br>The heated Swadhisthan and its Effects<br>This [Swadhisthan] center is very interesting. It comes out of the Solar Plexus, we call it as<br>Nabhi Chakra, and like a lotus it moves all round it. You can say in gross way it [manifests as]<br>the Aortic Plexus. … It is not [the Aortic Plexus], it supplies energy to the Aortic Plexus. This<br>54<br>center is very important because it gives energy to our liver, to the pancreas, to our spleen,<br>intestines and kidneys. …<br>But the most important work it does is … to supply energy to our gray cells [in the brain] which<br>we are using all the time. When we are thinking too much, when we are acting physically and<br>mentally, this center has to supply energy to our brain.<br>Ask the doctors how much we are using our gray cells? We have no idea. There is nobody who<br>has found out how much we use our brains, but we are going on exhausting our brains; we are<br>very futuristic.<br>What can happen medically to this Swadhisthan Chakra which has to supply [energy] to your<br>liver? The liver is the one which takes all the poison of the body and throws it into the circulation.<br>When liver is looked after, it is a normal process.<br>Then we have also a pancreas, a spleen, kidneys and the … intestines as a whole, but the last<br>part is very important. Such a man who is always thinking, all his energy is going to his brain<br>and all these organs are neglected and he can be affected by any one of them.<br>The first thing he is affected is a bad liver, because it cannot throw its heat, which is the poison<br>of the body, into the circulation. What happens, the heat starts rising; this heat goes higher on<br>the right side. There we call it Right Heart, the center which controls the lungs. Such a person<br>can get asthma.<br>This same thing happens to our pancreas, when it [the heat] moves to the left side. Now this heat<br>goes to the pancreas and gives you diabetes,<br>Then it goes down, then to the kidney; at the kidney it coagulates, and you cannot pass urine.<br>Also, it can give terrible constipation and with that you might get piles and things like that.<br>Now for the kidney, if you go to the dialysis, you not only die, but you die bankrupt. There is a<br>simple way of curing this kidney trouble and once this kidney is cured, it is cured forever. By<br>helping the Swadhisthan you can cure also the kidney.<br>The most difficult thing is the spleen. Now in modern times we are very hectic, and you see what<br>happens – the spleen, poor thing which has to produce red blood cells for emergencies, gets<br>mad. She cannot understand, “What is the matter with this gentleman?” and it cannot cooperate<br>with all the madness we have.<br>This futuristic life makes people really crazy. … The liver gives you heat, you become very hot<br>tempered at the slightest thing. You just shoot off and start saying things which you should never<br>have said. Then you feel guilty. When you feel guilty, you catch this center here, Left Vishuddhi<br>we call it, by which you develop spondylitis. …<br>Then this heat can pass to the spleen and then you get a disease called blood cancer.<br>55<br>According to Sahaja Yoga, we have two types of heart attacks. One is an active massive heart<br>attack and another one is what you call lethargic, like angina.<br>The first one is the massive one, where the heat reaches the heart. This heart suddenly collapses,<br>and they die. We call it an active heart attack due to over-acting.<br>Another one is the lethargic heart attack, like angina. That happens if this Vishuddhi center is<br>caught here, if you feel guilty.<br>The last but not the least is the effect of Swadhisthan as this heat reaches the brain and gives you<br>paralysis on the left-hand side. As you know, [the sympathetic nervous system] crosses over its<br>nerves. It gives you a terrible paralysis on the left-hand side, but you feel it on the right-hand side.<br>When the Kundalini rises, it nourishes those centers.<br>1997-04-06 Delhi, India and 1) 1998-10-02 Versilia, Italy<br>Spleen Issues<br>You get up in the morning and immediately start reading the newspaper, start getting agitated<br>and your speedometer has started shaking, with news like this person has been beaten, that<br>person has been hit.<br>The chakra, which is resting in your stomach, this speedometer is showing its effect. After this,<br>you get up and rush. You thought you go by vehicle, but there is lot of heavy traffic. Again, you are<br>frustrated. With great difficulty, on reaching office, there you find a lot of problems. You have not<br>taken proper food. Whatever food that is given by your wife, you are just gobbling it. There is lot<br>of trouble in this, and it results in blood cancer.<br>Because of a hectic life, running here, there – your speedometer gets spoilt as the red blood<br>corpuscles which have to make blood cells, go mad. In this madness, which we call ‘go crazy’, it<br>[the spleen] does not know which method to be used to supply blood to this mad person. Now<br>this, what you call ‘vulnerability’, has started with regard to your cancer. With this, call it either<br>black magic, bhoot vidya, or [false] guru prasad, or any such type of things – if they enter your<br>internal system, then blood cancer will be caused.<br>If any mother is of this type, in trouble from morning to evening, … this disease can happen to<br>her children also if she is pregnant at that point of time.<br>The entire society is made like this where everybody is working in troubled condition and<br>in chaos. On account of this, there is the possibility of getting blood cancer. According to<br>my thinking, there is nothing as such, for which a human being has to hurry up and create<br>confusion.<br>How can this be treated? The treatment is that, as soon as the Kundalini comes to your Nabhi<br>Chakra, peace will prevail. A human being becomes peaceful. He will be looking at things<br>56<br>peacefully. But that restless nature within us, that today’s nature is such that you are making a<br>venue for cancer to put its effect on you.<br>1986-04-02 Kolkata, India<br>Void Problems<br>The ‘Void’ can be spoilt by drugs and bad gurus. If you bow before any wrong guru, you catch<br>your Ekadesha Rudra. On the left side when you have been dominated in your guru tattva, going<br>to wrong gurus and doing wrong things.<br>Problems with the right side come if you think you are a great guru, of if you have tried to<br>dominate others by your ‘magnetism’. When the Ekadesha Rudra becomes very strong on the<br>physical level, you get horrible troubles with the body like cancer. Actually, cancer can be felt on<br>the stomach. You can feel the ‘lub-dub’ [of the pulse] on the stomach itself.<br>Problems come with spending your money for a wrong purpose or if somebody wants to make<br>money out of Sahaja, drinking too much, drugs, telling lies, stealing, killing … – all these<br>ten commandments. Fanaticism is against dharma. There are adharmic things as cabaret<br>dancing, adultery, undignified behaviour, alcohol, wrong gurus, reading bad books, fanaticism,<br>denouncing religions, materialism etc.<br>Various talks combined<br>Void Treatments<br>The ‘Void’ … can be cured by saying the mantra for the Adi Guru. Left-side guru tattva means<br>when you have had other [‘false’] gurus, then you have to say, ‘I am my own guru’. If you have<br>‘right’ side[affected], you have to say, ‘Mother you are my guru’. So, the five [dharmas] on the<br>right, and the five on the left can be solved.<br>What is the eleventh one? It is the Spirit, the Atma. For that you have to say, ‘I am the Spirit’.<br>The five left-side dharmas are corrected by taking vibrated salt, and the five right-side dharmas<br>are corrected by taking vibrated sugar. If someone drinks some water that has been vibrated that<br>person becomes dharmic.<br>Diarrhea is sometimes important to cleanse you out. It is alright because diarrhea and also<br>vomiting are a parasympathetic activity. It is clearing out.<br>Various talks combined<br>Vishuddhi Problems<br>On the left side, if you have been immoral, then there is the sister relationship, the guilt, confusion<br>with relationships with other men and other women. If we have a bad Agnya, or if there are eyes<br>57<br>which are roving, then this Left Vishuddhi causes a lot of trouble. Then we get problems like<br>sarcasm, shyness, timidity, problems of inferiority complex, slyness and people who never talk,<br>are uncollective, fearful and frightened and always see negativity in others, giving explanations,<br>instead of facing your faults and saying, ‘I was wrong’.<br>If you are lacking in protocol, as soon as you cross the limits, Left Vishuddhi is created.<br>There should be awe, respect for your Holy Mother.<br>Show-off, disturbing, or trying to be overpowering, or being a very forward person, or<br>bumptiousness – all these come from a Left Vishuddhi, because you want to overcome your Left<br>Vishuddhi; so you do it and then it is added to.<br>Tell yourself, “No! I have done this today, … tomorrow I am going to do it. … No! Stop it now!<br>Stop!”<br>On Center Vishuddhi there could be problems when we talk against God or are against God or<br>collectivity; [there could be] problems with communication, collectivity and an inability to sing,<br>If we take responsibility of everything upon ourselves it can result in tensions and headaches.<br>The remedy is to witness and realize that everything is done by the Divine. Most of us have bad<br>Vishuddhis, because we do not take responsibility, we take to negativity more easily and want<br>special things for ourselves.<br>On the right side it gives all kinds of political problems, we talk too much, too loudly or use our<br>words to intimidate others, be aggressive, arrogant or blunt. This is counteracted by madhuria,<br>sweetness, and also by going into mauna, silence. Sneezing is nothing but the Right Vishuddhi<br>opening out.<br>The problems can include hoarseness or loss of voice, if you take the name of God in vain, have<br>a habit of smiling for nothing at all, eyes that go on looking and pouring their greedy or lusty<br>eyes onto others – this is the worst thing you can do to your eyes – and showing anger with the<br>eyes, they can become mesmeric. It is a very, very dangerous thing to go on looking at something<br>continuously with concentration. Too much of nodding is very bad for the Vishuddhi Chakra.<br>There are so many problems … like Angina, Spondylitis, losing the voice completely or all the<br>time coughing. … Above all is the center of discrimination [the Hamsa Chakra] which only<br>comes [open] when you are free people. As long as you are biased, have your own concepts,<br>you cannot be discreet. … Some people think by their talks they can cheat you, by sweet talks,<br>artificial talks or by some maneuvering. They will get exposed and people know about them that<br>these are the greatest liars ever known.<br>1986-08-23 Plaffeien, Switzerland et al.<br>58<br>Vishuddhi Chakra Treatment<br>There is another thing called primrose oil. You can get two or three drops and take it with water.<br>That will also soothe your Vishuddhi. The oil keeps your Vishuddhi alright.<br>Olive oil can be used for a massage on the Vishuddhi, as well as the head and backbone. When<br>you touch somebody with oil, the Krishna tattva acts, because Krishna is the one who represents<br>the madhuria, the sweetness of your character. The voice should be melodious, and the language<br>should be controlled for saying things which are sweet and beautiful – speak of Sahaja Yoga.<br>Protect the throat from cold conditions from very childhood by having something around your<br>neck.<br>To correct the Left Vishuddhi, put the left hand towards the Mother or the photo, and right hand<br>on Mother Earth. Give a bandhan to the Left Vishuddhi and say in your heart, “Mother I am not<br>guilty”. Say it from your heart. Forget the past.<br>For the Right Vishuddhi, basil can be taken in tea and can be followed by an ajwain dhuni<br>treatment. It is corrected by madhuria, sweetness, and also by going into mauna, silence. There<br>is also the mantra of ‘Radha Krishna’, or ‘Vitthala’, where are problems of ears, nose and throat<br>or where you get bad colds, or your attention gets diverted.<br>To clear out most of your problems about Vishuddhi you have to put your fingers into your ears<br>and say ‘Allah ho Akbar’ 16 times.<br>1985-05-02 Vienna, Austria et al.<br>The Kavach of the Devi<br>This famous ancient prayer, asking for one’s protection of the Devi is a rich source of mantras,<br>assigning a specific deity to the various parts of the body for their protection.<br>You can use the entire Kavach or for a specific part of the body only the name of the<br>corresponding deity.

<p>60<br>From mana, from the Mind, jada comes in<br>Can we go through it? Is it [the Mooladhara] overdeveloped or underdeveloped? That is<br>the general principle for everything: If it overdeveloped then it is a ‘hot’ Mooladhara; if it<br>is underdeveloped it is a ‘cool’ Mooladhara. A hot Mooladhara is the Mooladhara which is<br>overused or has too much of heat, is overactive. …<br>Mooladhara is [collecting] jada. And over-activity creates more jada. [It is] like carbon dioxide<br>or anything like that, a waste product. All the waste products become inert and that inertness<br>gives additional size to the prostate. Then this jada can go into arthritis also.<br>Because whatever is jada, inert, is actually vibrations, frozen. They are a frozen type. …<br>It is like, if you put some colour in the hair, it settles down. Whatever jada you catch in the eyes,<br>it settles down. And if this gets spoiled then the prostate goes out. …<br>This has come because of over-reading, of seeing bad things, of all sort of things. The best thing<br>is for this, sleep on the Mother Earth and see the Mother Earth itself.<br>Then this inert material starts accumulating, and that is how you get this [prostate problem]. …<br>Doctor: Let us say that they have too much jada in that [overactive] Mooladhara – how to release<br>it Mother?<br>Shri Mataji: what I am saying that when you have your Mooladhara attacked in this way that it is<br>all clustered into jada. Now how to release the Mooladhara is the problem. Now the best thing<br>would be to sit on the Mother Earth when this is our Sahaja Yoga. … And you put your feet up<br>from the Mother Earth. Put your Mooladhara absolutely there and ask Mother Earth to suck<br>these problems. …<br>Then there is another way, you lie down on the Mother Earth. Lift your hands, lift your body, lift<br>your legs and just allow your Mooladhara to touch the Mother Earth, even for a short time. And<br>then try to rub it. It sucks all the problems. …<br>First of all, take a [pardon] (ask for forgiveness; ed.) that we have done these mistakes and we<br>have done in ignorance, and we have accumulated lots of inert thing. So better take them away.<br>Doctor: Another way to release jada is foot soaking, isn’t it?<br>Second Doctor: In the ocean is great.<br>Shri Mataji: Yes, but the best would be to sit in the sand, make a hole and put your feet up to this<br>much inside.<br>Jada comes from all the five elements. What I was trying to tell you that even from mana the jada<br>comes in. Even from mana, from the mind, jada comes in.<br>1982-07-10 Derby, UK<br>61<br>Bald Heads<br>You have two types of bald heads, as I told you. Some who start from here and some who start<br>from there. (Shri Mataji points to the front of Her head and then to the back of Her head; ed.) It<br>is a very interesting subject.

The Left Nabhi relationship is the Gruha Lakshmi relationship.<br>When you adore your wife so much that she is no more a Gruha Lakshmi, this also is a<br>wrong thing.<br>Also, it could be because of your hectic life.
